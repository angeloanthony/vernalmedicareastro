// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// src/types/MedicationAssistance.ts — contracts for the Prescription
// Assistance project (docs/PRESCRIPTION-ASSISTANCE-PROJECT.md §17–§18).
//
// A MedicationAssistanceRecord is the independently-researched, source-tracked
// assistance profile for ONE brand medication. It extends — never replaces —
// the existing `Drug` entry in data/drugs.ts: the record's `slug` must match a
// FEATURED_DRUGS slug, so every medication keeps exactly one canonical page at
// /<slug>-assistance-program.html. Records live in data/medicationAssistance/.
//
// Design rules encoded here:
//   • Every program carries its own `sources[]` with a `checked` date, so a
//     maintainer can answer "where did this claim come from, and when?"
//     without re-researching (spec §18, §25).
//   • `kind` keeps the four kinds of help apart — a commercial copay card is
//     NOT a patient-assistance program, and neither is a charitable grant or
//     Medicare Extra Help (spec §5B, §16 Rule 5).
//   • `status` distinguishes "listed" from "accepting applications" (spec §6).
//   • `medicare` records what the OFFICIAL program says about Medicare
//     enrollees, never an inference from a sibling drug (spec §11).

// ── Taxonomy: two axes, one classification each ──────────────────────────────
//
// Adopted 2026-08-26 (docs/PRESCRIPTION-ASSISTANCE-TAXONOMY-AUDIT.md). A
// medication is classified on exactly two independent axes:
//
//   conditions  — what the patient has        (data/conditions.ts, CANONICAL)
//   drugClass   — what the medication IS      (data/medicationAssistance/drugClasses.ts)
//
// `conditions` is load-bearing beyond navigation: programsForDrug() matches
// nonprofit disease funds by condition key, so a wrong key shows the wrong
// charitable grants. Never rename or reinterpret a condition key without
// auditing every consumer.
//
// Browse categories are NOT a third axis. An AssistanceCategory is a *derived
// view* over the two axes — see categoriesFor(). A record is never tagged with
// a category, which is what previously duplicated 'diabetes' and 'heart' in the
// taxonomy tags.

/** Pharmacological / therapeutic class — what the medication IS. Extend the
