// Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) — Novartis. Independently researched
// 2026-08-26. Every program below was read on the official source cited with
// it. Batch 2 (spec §24 #6) — migrates the legacy generic page in place.
//
// The Entresto picture changed in 2025–26: generic sacubitril/valsartan is on
// the U.S. market, Novartis discontinued the Entresto Co-Pay Program, and
// Entresto is NOT on the Novartis Patient Assistance Foundation medication
// list. Two of the "programs" below are therefore honest negatives.

  drugClass: ['arni'],
  description:
    'Entresto is a twice-daily heart-failure tablet that combines sacubitril, a neprilysin inhibitor, with valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker. Generic sacubitril/valsartan has been on the U.S. market since 2025, which changes the assistance picture more than any program does.',
  usedFor: [
    'Reducing the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic heart failure',
    'Treating symptomatic heart failure with systemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction in children aged one year and older (tablets and Entresto Sprinkle oral pellets)',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Brand Entresto is usually placed on a brand tier with a copay or coinsurance every month. Two things now cut against that cost: Medicare\'s negotiated price of $295 for a 30-day supply took effect in January 2026, and FDA-approved generic sacubitril/valsartan tablets — from more than a dozen labelers — reached pharmacies in 2025. But Novartis has also withdrawn its own help: the Entresto Co-Pay Program is discontinued and Entresto is not on the Novartis Patient Assistance Foundation list.',
  medicareContext:
    'Entresto is generally covered under Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans, sometimes with prior authorization or step therapy. It is one of the first ten drugs with a Medicare-negotiated Maximum Fair Price: $295.00 for a 30-day supply in 2026 (versus a $628 list price in 2023, per CMS). That is the price to your plan — your copay still depends on your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, and Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. Ask your pharmacist whether generic sacubitril/valsartan costs less on your plan.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'The manufacturer routes are gone, but the generic is here. Novartis discontinued the Entresto Co-Pay Program and does not list Entresto in its patient assistance foundation. What remains: generic sacubitril/valsartan (ask your pharmacist), one zip-code-limited TotalAssist heart-failure fund that was open when we checked, Medicare\'s negotiated price, and Extra Help. The main heart-failure charity funds at TotalAssist and HealthWell were closed to new applicants.',

      'Generic sacubitril/valsartan: FDA-approved since May 2024 and on the market since 2025 — ask whether it is cheaper on your plan\'s formulary.',

      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Entresto right now?',
      answer:
        'One, with a catch. On August 26, 2026 TotalAssist\'s heart-failure health-equity fund was open, but it is limited to home zip codes in designated social-vulnerability counties. TotalAssist\'s main Heart failure and Cardiomyopathy funds and HealthWell\'s Chronic Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathy Medicare Access funds were closed to new applicants. Sign up for alerts and check back — funds open when money arrives.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the $295 Entresto price?',
      answer:
        'It is Medicare\'s negotiated Maximum Fair Price for a 30-day supply of Entresto in 2026, down from a $628 list price in 2023 according to CMS. It sets what Part D plans pay; your copay is set by your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, so your out-of-pocket amount may be higher or lower than $295 depending on where you are in your deductible and the annual cap.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if the fund is closed?',
      answer:
        'TotalAssist offers text, email or phone notifications when a fund opens, with no waitlist or queue; HealthWell offers alerts for each fund. While you wait, the routes that do not depend on a fund balance are the generic, Extra Help, a formulary exception through your doctor, and a Part D plan comparison in the fall.
