// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Brilinta (ticagrelor) — AstraZeneca. Independently researched 2026-08-26.
// Every program below was read on the official source cited with it. Batch 7 —
// a NEW slug, selected for information value rather than for demand.
//
// Two reasons this page earns its place. First, it is the registry's first
// ANTIPLATELET. The "Blood Thinners" browse view has always described itself as
// "Anticoagulants and antiplatelets", and until now every medication in it was
// an anticoagulant — Eliquis and Xarelto. That is a real gap for readers,
// because "blood thinner" is one phrase covering two different kinds of
// medicine with different uses, and this page is where the difference gets
// explained.
//
// Second, the honest answer here is unusual and useful: there is NO manufacturer
// route to the brand for a Medicare beneficiary. Brilinta is not on the AZ&Me
// medication list and not on AstraZeneca Direct, both checked on their own
// pages — the same finding Batch 6 made for Symbicort. What a Medicare
// beneficiary actually has is generic ticagrelor, which DailyMed lists under 35
// separate labels. The page says so plainly rather than padding the manufacturer
// section.
//
// That finding also disproves the legacy `azme` tagline, which named Brilinta.
// Corrected in data/drugs.ts in this batch under the Sanofi/AbbVie precedent —
// prose only, `drugs[]` untouched.
//
// Research gap carried honestly: brilinta.com renders its Commercial Insurance
// and Medicare Part D pages client-side, so the savings-card terms could not be
// read; the page also carries a 2024 copyright and update stamp. The savings
// card is therefore `verify` with no dollar figures.

  description:
    'Brilinta is a twice-daily antiplatelet tablet — a blood thinner, but a different kind from Eliquis or Xarelto. Those are anticoagulants, which slow the clotting proteins in blood and are used for atrial fibrillation and clots in the legs and lungs. Brilinta stops platelets sticking together in the arteries, which is what causes a heart attack or an artery-blocking stroke. The two kinds are not interchangeable, and the programs that help pay for them are not the same either.',
  usedFor: [
    'Reducing the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in people with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or a history of heart attack — and reducing the risk of clotting in a stent placed for ACS',
    'Reducing the risk of a first heart attack or stroke in people with coronary artery disease (CAD) at high risk for those events',
    'Reducing the risk of stroke in people having an acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale score of 5 or less) or a high-risk transient ischemic attack',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Brand Brilinta sits on a brand tier in most Part D plans, and it is taken twice a day for a year or more after a heart attack or stent, so cost-sharing accumulates. What changes the arithmetic completely is that generic ticagrelor now exists: DailyMed lists 35 labelled ticagrelor products, only one of which is AstraZeneca\'s brand. That matters more than usual here, because AstraZeneca offers a Medicare beneficiary no route to the brand at all — Brilinta is on neither the AZ&Me patient assistance list nor AstraZeneca Direct, and the two charitable funds that cover it were closed.',
  medicareContext:
    'Brilinta is a tablet you take yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, usually on a brand tier — while generic ticagrelor typically sits on a much lower generic tier. It is not a Medicare-negotiated drug: CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Brilinta or ticagrelor row for 2026, 2027 or 2028. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan can spread what you owe across the year. Because there is no manufacturer program for this medication, those Medicare-side routes and the generic are the whole picture.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Not from the manufacturer — and that is the useful finding. Brilinta is not on AstraZeneca\'s AZ&Me patient assistance list and not on AstraZeneca Direct, so there is no free-drug or cash-price route to the brand. Both charitable funds that list Brilinta were closed, and HealthWell has no applicable fund at all. What a Medicare beneficiary does have is generic ticagrelor, Extra Help, and a plan comparison.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Brilinta?',
      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Brilinta, usually on a brand tier, while generic ticagrelor typically sits on a much lower generic tier. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Brilinta patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Brilinta is not on the AZ&Me Prescription Savings Program medication list — we read that list on August 26, 2026 — and it is not offered through AstraZeneca Direct either. This surprises people because AZ&Me does have a Medicare pathway, and because brilinta.com still names AZ&Me in its trademark footer; but the program\'s first requirement is being treated with a medication it actually carries. For Brilinta the routes are generic ticagrelor, Extra Help, and the charitable funds if they reopen.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Brilinta the same kind of blood thinner as Eliquis or Xarelto?',
      answer:
        'No, and the difference matters when you are looking for help paying for it. Eliquis and Xarelto are anticoagulants — they slow the clotting proteins in blood, and are used for atrial fibrillation and for clots in the legs and lungs. Brilinta is an antiplatelet: the label calls it "a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor", and it stops platelets clumping in the arteries after a heart attack, a stent or an ischemic stroke. They are prescribed for different problems, and the assistance programs and charity funds that cover them are different too.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Brilinta right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Brilinta on its Stroke fund and its CAD health equity fund and both were closed, each with a $1,000 guaranteed and $1,500 maximum award. HealthWell runs no coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndrome or stroke fund at all, and Good Days has none either. Set a TotalAssist alert, but plan around the generic rather than waiting for a fund.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Brilinta?',
      answer:
        'Yes, and it is widely available: DailyMed lists 35 labelled ticagrelor products, of which AstraZeneca\'s Brilinta is one. TotalAssist lists generic ticagrelor on the same funds as the brand. Since there is no manufacturer assistance program for this medication, asking your prescriber and plan about the generic is usually the single largest saving available.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Brilinta part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price data file has no Brilinta or ticagrelor row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028 — which is unsurprising for a medicine that already has generic competition, since the program selects drugs without it. Your cost is set by your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing. See <a href="/prescription-drug-assistance.html">all prescription assistance options</a>.',
