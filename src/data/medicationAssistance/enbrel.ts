// Enbrel (etanercept) — Immunex Corporation, a subsidiary of Amgen.
// Independently researched 2026-08-26. Every program below was read on the
// official source cited with it. Batch 3 (spec §24 #13) — a NEW page.
//
// Enbrel is the only medication in the project so far whose Medicare price was
// set by negotiation rather than by a plan: it is one of the ten drugs in the
// first cycle of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, with a Maximum
// Fair Price in effect since January 1, 2026. That fact, not a program, is the
// main thing that changed for Part D beneficiaries this year.
//
// EVIDENCE NOTE on the Amgen Safety Net Foundation Medicare question: two
// official ASNF pages point in different directions. The FAQ says the
// foundation "supports financially needy uninsured patients" who "must not be
// eligible for Medicaid, Medicare, or any other financial support options";
// the eligibility page allows, "for certain products," a "qualifying Medicare
// patient with an affordability gap." The Enbrel-specific application (Jul
// 2026) lists only "You have no insurance coverage" and does not name Enbrel
// as one of those products. Rather than pick a side, this record carries
// `medicare: 'unknown'` and tells the reader to ask the program about Enbrel
// specifically — the honest reading of a contradictory source.

  // "Enbrel is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker" (label) — a biologic.
  drugClass: ['biologic'],
  description:
    'Enbrel is a self-injected TNF blocker used for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis, and for several forms of juvenile arthritis. For people on Medicare it is unusual in one respect: Enbrel is one of the first ten drugs whose Part D price Medicare negotiated directly.',
  usedFor: [
    'Moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in adults',
    'Active psoriatic arthritis in adults',
    'Active ankylosing spondylitis in adults',
    'Chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults, and in children 4 and older',
    'Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis in patients 2 and older',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Enbrel is a specialty-tier biologic, so most Part D plans charge a percentage of the price rather than a flat copay — and the price is high enough that people commonly reach the annual out-of-pocket cap in the first months of the year. CMS put Enbrel\'s 2023 list price at $7,106 for a 30-day supply. There is no etanercept generic, and the manufacturer\'s own copay card is closed to anyone with Medicare.',
  medicareContext:
    'Enbrel is generally covered under Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans, usually on a specialty tier and often with prior authorization or step therapy. It is also one of the ten drugs selected in the first cycle of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program: CMS agreed a Maximum Fair Price of $2,355.00 for a 30-day supply, in effect since January 1, 2026 — a 67% discount from the $7,106.00 list price CMS recorded for 2023. That is the price your plan pays; what you pay still depends on your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, which is why the $2,100 Part D out-of-pocket cap and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan both matter here. Around 48,000 Part D enrollees used Enbrel in 2023, by CMS\'s count.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Enbrel is the rare case where the biggest relief for a Medicare beneficiary came from Medicare itself, not from a program. The negotiated Part D price took effect in January 2026. The manufacturer\'s copay card excludes Medicare, Amgen\'s foundation is built for uninsured patients, and every autoimmune charity fund we checked was closed to new applicants.',
    points: [
      'Medicare negotiated price: $2,355.00 for a 30-day supply in 2026, down from a $7,106.00 list price in 2023. It applies to your Part D plan — your own copay still depends on your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing.',
      'ENBREL Co-Pay Card: commercially insured patients only, and available to them regardless of income. Amgen\'s terms rule it out where the product is paid for in whole or in part by Medicare, Medicaid or another federal or state program, and it is not valid for cash-paying patients either.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Enbrel?',
      answer:
        'Generally yes. Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans cover Enbrel, usually on a specialty tier and often with prior authorization or step therapy. Enbrel is also one of the first ten drugs in the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program: CMS set a Maximum Fair Price of $2,355.00 for a 30-day supply, in effect since January 1, 2026. That is what your plan pays — your own share still depends on your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, capped at $2,100 out of pocket in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can lower a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Enbrel part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Enbrel is one of the ten Part D drugs selected in the first negotiation cycle. CMS published a negotiated price of $2,355.00 per 30-day supply for 2026 against a $7,106.00 list price in 2023 — a 67% discount. CMS counted about 48,000 Part D enrollees using Enbrel in 2023. Important nuance: the negotiated price lowers what your plan pays, so whether you feel it depends on how your plan sets your coinsurance.',

    {
      question: 'Can people with Medicare use the Amgen Safety Net Foundation for Enbrel?',
      answer:
        'We could not settle this from Amgen\'s own pages, so we are telling you that rather than guessing. The foundation\'s FAQ describes it as a program for "financially needy uninsured patients" who "must not be eligible for Medicaid, Medicare, or any other financial support options," and the Enbrel application form lists the insurance requirement as "You have no insurance coverage." But the foundation\'s eligibility page also says that "for certain products" a qualifying Medicare patient with an affordability gap may be eligible — without saying whether Enbrel is one of them. Call Amgen SupportPlus at 1-866-264-2778 and ask about Enbrel by name.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the ENBREL Co-Pay Card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Amgen\'s terms exclude the co-pay program where the product is paid for in whole or in part by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federal or state healthcare program, and it is not valid for cash-paying patients either. Enbrel.com states the card is for patients with commercial insurance, regardless of income level. Federal anti-kickback rules are the reason — see the key terms lower on this page.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What does Amgen offer Medicare patients, then?',
      answer:
        'Help finding money rather than money. Amgen SupportPlus says its representatives can help you understand your current Medicare plan and the out-of-pocket costs you should expect for Enbrel, identify other local plan options if you want to switch, refer you for Medicare Extra Help if you are eligible, and put you in touch with independent nonprofit foundations. Amgen notes it has no control over those nonprofit programs. Call 1-888-4ENBREL (1-888-436-2735), Monday–Friday 8am–8pm ET.',

    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Enbrel right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Enbrel under its rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis funds, and HealthWell lists it on the AutoImmune – Medicare Access fund. All five were closed to new applicants. Good Days has no matching fund. Sign up for alerts at both foundations and check back; funds reopen when money arrives.',

    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Enbrel?',
      answer:
        'There is no etanercept generic on the U.S. market. Because Enbrel is a biologic, the comparable products are biosimilars rather than generics; ask your plan or pharmacist what your formulary covers for etanercept and what tier it sits on before assuming a lower-cost version is available to you.
