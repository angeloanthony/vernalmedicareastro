// Trulicity (dulaglutide) — Eli Lilly and Company. Independently researched
// 2026-08-26. Every program below was read on the official source cited with
// it. Batch 3 (spec §24 #11) — a NEW page.
//
// RESEARCH NOTE (access): lilly.com and lillycares.com serve a Cloudflare JS
// challenge on the `www` host. The apex hosts (lillycares.com,
// trulicity.com → trulicity.lilly.com) serve the same pages without it, so
// every Lilly fact here was read on the official page, not on a summary.
//
// The Lilly Cares finding is drug-specific in both directions: Trulicity is
// named in Group 1, and Lilly Cares separately flags restricted products
// ("Reyvow availability is limited to currently enrolled and re-enrolling
// patients") — Trulicity carries no such flag, and the page carries a banner
// saying new Trulicity applications are being accepted again. Contrast the
// Mounjaro record, where the same list omits the drug entirely.

  description:
    'Trulicity is a once-weekly injection that helps lower blood sugar in adults and children aged 10 and older with type 2 diabetes, and lowers the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes who already have heart disease or several risk factors for it.',
  usedFor: [

    'Reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes who have established cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Trulicity is a brand-only injectable with no generic, so Part D plans place it on a brand or specialty tier where you pay a percentage of the price rather than a flat copay. GLP-1 medicines are also a common target for prior authorization and step therapy, which can delay a fill or push you toward a different medicine first.',
  medicareContext:
    'Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Trulicity when it is prescribed for type 2 diabetes — Part D covers GLP-1 medicines for diabetes, not for weight loss alone. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan lets you spread that across monthly payments. Trulicity is not on the Medicare-negotiated drug lists for 2026 or 2027, so your cost is set entirely by your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing. One thing to know before you go looking: the Medicare GLP-1 Bridge does not apply to you if your plan already covers Trulicity.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Trulicity?',
      answer:
        'Generally yes, when it is prescribed for type 2 diabetes. Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans cover GLP-1 medicines such as Trulicity for diabetes — not for weight loss alone — often on a brand or specialty tier and sometimes with prior authorization or step therapy. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can lower a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Trulicity patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Yes. The Lilly Cares Foundation lists Trulicity as a Group 1 medication, which it defines as "for patients who have no insurance or have Medicare Part D and have a household annual adjusted gross income ≤ 300% Federal Poverty Level." On the program\'s 2026 table that is $47,880 for one person or $64,920 for two. You are not eligible if you are enrolled in Medicaid, full Extra Help or VA benefits. Apply at lillycares.com or call 1-800-545-6962.',
    },
    {
      question: 'I heard Lilly Cares stopped taking Trulicity applications. Is that still true?',
      answer:
        'Not as of August 26, 2026. The Lilly Cares available-medications page carries a notice saying "New applications for Trulicity are once again being accepted, and no longer require a medical exception request." Lilly Cares flags restricted products on that same page — Reyvow, for example, is marked as limited to currently enrolled and re-enrolling patients — and Trulicity carries no such restriction. Check the page before you apply, because these notices change.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Trulicity Savings Card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Lilly\'s card terms require that you not be enrolled in any state, federal or government-funded healthcare program, and name Medicare, Medicare Part D, Medicare Advantage, Medigap, Medicaid, DoD, VA and TRICARE. If you begin receiving drug coverage under any of those, Lilly asks you to call 1-866-923-1953 to stop participation. Federal rules are the reason — see the key terms lower on this page.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does the Medicare GLP-1 Bridge cover Trulicity for $50 a month?',
      answer:
        'No. The Bridge is a CMS demonstration running July 1, 2026 through December 31, 2027 for weight management, and Trulicity is not one of its covered drugs. Two of its rules exclude you anyway: you are not eligible if you can receive a GLP-1 drug through your Medicare drug plan — and Medicare\'s definition of a GLP-1 drug names dulaglutide, the active ingredient in Trulicity — and you are not eligible if you have type 2 diabetes, because your plan should already cover a GLP-1 for you.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Trulicity right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Trulicity under its Type 2 diabetes fund and the health-equity version of that fund, and HealthWell lists it on its Type 2 Diabetes fund — all three were closed to new applicants. Good Days has no diabetes fund. Sign up for TotalAssist and HealthWell alerts and check back; funds reopen when money arrives.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Trulicity?',
      answer:
        'No. Dulaglutide is a brand-only injectable with no generic or biosimilar on the U.S. market. If cost is the problem, ask your doctor whether a different diabetes medicine on your plan\'s preferred tier would work for you, and see <a href="/prescription-drug-assistance.html">all prescription assistance options</a>.',
