// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Daliresp (roflumilast) — AstraZeneca. Independently researched 2026-08-26.
// Batch 8 — a NEW slug.
//
// Daliresp is the only COPD medication in this registry that is not an inhaler,
// and that is the whole point of the page. It is a once-daily tablet that works
// on inflammation, and its own label says it "is not a bronchodilator and is not
// indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm". People prescribed it
// alongside an inhaler routinely assume it is a substitute for one, and the
// assistance landscape rewards knowing the difference.
//
// The headline finding is a negative that turns into a positive:
//   • AstraZeneca offers a Medicare beneficiary NO route to brand Daliresp. It is
//     not on the AZ&Me medication list (15 products, each with its own downloadable
//     application) and not on AstraZeneca Direct. This is the third time the
//     project has found this exact AstraZeneca shape — Symbicort and Brilinta were
//     the first two.
//   • But roflumilast is comprehensively generic: DailyMed lists 20 labelled
//     products across 18 labelers, TotalAssist lists "Roflumilast" on the COPD
//     fund alongside the brand, and the federal TrumpRx site prices generic
//     roflumilast at $13.48. For a Medicare beneficiary that generic is almost
//     certainly the entire answer, and saying so plainly is more useful than
//     padding the manufacturer section.
//
// TAXONOMY: introduces `pde4-inhibitor`. The label Highlights say "DALIRESP is a
// selective phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor". None of the inhaler classes can carry
// an oral tablet, and 'kinase-inhibitor' names a different enzyme family, so the
// existing vocabulary demonstrably could not represent it.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Daliresp is a once-daily tablet for severe COPD — not an inhaler, and not a substitute for one. It works by reducing inflammation in the lungs to cut the number of flare-ups, and its label says plainly that it "is not a bronchodilator and is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm". It is added to inhaler treatment rather than replacing it.',

  whyCostly:
    'Brand Daliresp sits on a brand tier in most Part D plans, and AstraZeneca offers a Medicare beneficiary no route to it at all — Daliresp is on neither the AZ&Me patient assistance list nor AstraZeneca Direct. What changes the arithmetic completely is that roflumilast is thoroughly generic: DailyMed lists 20 labelled products across 18 different labelers, and the federal TrumpRx site prices generic roflumilast at $13.48. For most people on Medicare the generic is not a fallback here — it is the answer.',
  medicareContext:
    'Daliresp is a tablet you take yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, usually with brand Daliresp on a brand tier and generic roflumilast on a much lower generic tier. It is not a Medicare-negotiated drug: CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Daliresp or roflumilast row for 2026, 2027 or 2028 — unsurprising for a medicine that already has generic competition, since the program selects drugs without it. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan can spread what you owe across the year.',

    'The charitable picture for Daliresp matters less than it does for almost anything else on this site, and that is good news rather than bad. TotalAssist lists both the brand and the generic "Roflumilast" on its COPD fund and COPD health equity fund, each paying $1,200 guaranteed up to $3,500, and both were closed on August 26, 2026. HealthWell\'s COPD – Medicare Access fund was closed as well, and Good Days runs no COPD fund. But with 18 different labelers making generic roflumilast and a published federal cash price of $13.48, the cost problem this medication presents is usually solved at the pharmacy counter rather than by a grant. Set a TotalAssist alert if you like, and in the meantime ask your prescriber about the generic.',

    'Extra Help does the ordinary thing here rather than anything special: it lowers cost-sharing on every covered drug you take.

        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Daliresp, usually with brand Daliresp on a brand tier and generic roflumilast on a much lower generic tier. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Daliresp patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Daliresp is not on the AZ&Me Prescription Savings Program medication list — we read that list on August 26, 2026 — and it is not offered through AstraZeneca Direct either. This is the same finding the project has recorded for Symbicort and Brilinta, both also AstraZeneca products. For Daliresp the routes are generic roflumilast, Extra Help, and the charitable funds if they reopen.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Daliresp?',
      answer:
        'Yes, and it is thoroughly established: DailyMed lists 20 labelled roflumilast products across 18 different labelers, including Micro Labs, Ascend, Aurobindo, AvKARE and Golden State Medical Supply. The federal TrumpRx site prices generic roflumilast at $13.48. TotalAssist lists the generic on the same COPD funds as the brand. Since there is no manufacturer assistance program for this medication, asking your prescriber and plan about the generic is by far the largest saving available.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Daliresp an inhaler, or does it replace one?',
      answer:
        'Neither. Daliresp is a tablet you swallow once a day, and it does not replace an inhaler. Its own label says it "is not a bronchodilator and is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm" — it reduces inflammation to cut the number of COPD flare-ups over time, alongside your inhalers rather than instead of them. If cost is pushing you to choose between Daliresp and an inhaler, that is a decision for your prescriber to make with you, because the two do different jobs.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Daliresp part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Daliresp or roflumilast row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028 — which is unsurprising for a medicine that already has generic competition, since the program selects drugs without it. Your cost is set by your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, and by whether you are dispensed the brand or the generic. See <a href="/prescription-drug-assistance.html">all prescription assistance options</a>.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Daliresp right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists both Daliresp and generic roflumilast on its COPD fund and COPD health equity fund, and both were closed, each with a $1,200 guaranteed and $3,500 maximum award. HealthWell\'s COPD – Medicare Access fund was closed too, and Good Days has no COPD fund. Given the generic price, a grant is likely to matter less for this medication than for most on this site.',
