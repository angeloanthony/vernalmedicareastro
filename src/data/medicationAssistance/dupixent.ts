// Dupixent (dupilumab) — Sanofi and Regeneron. Independently researched
// 2026-08-26. Batch 4 — the LAST legacy page to migrate, so this record keeps
// the legacy page's datePublished (2026-06-30) rather than taking today's.
//
// Three findings here were checked rather than inherited, and each contradicts
// something a reasonable person would have assumed:
//
//  1. Sanofi Patient Connection does NOT cover Dupixent. Its own
//     medications-available list names 20 medicines — Admelog, Lantus,
//     Lovenox, Toujeo and so on — and Dupixent is not among them (zero
//     occurrences in the page source). The Dupixent route is the separate
//     DUPIXENT MyWay Patient Assistance Program run for the brand. Our own
//     data/drugs.ts assistance-program directory still says otherwise; that is
//     recorded in the project doc as a defect to fix outside this batch.
//
//  2. HealthWell's AutoImmune – Medicare Access fund does NOT list Dupixent,
//     even though it lists Humira, Enbrel, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Dupixent's
//     HealthWell listings are the Asthma, COPD and Urticaria funds instead.
//     Exactly the sibling-drug inference spec §11 forbids.
//
//  3. The TotalAssist Eosinophilic Esophagitis fund was OPEN — the first open
//     charitable fund found anywhere in this project. Every other fund
//     matching a Dupixent indication was closed. "Charity funds are closed" had
//     started to look like a rule; it is not one, and the page says so.
//
// Dupixent is also the taxonomy stress test the project was waiting for: nine
// FDA-approved indications spanning skin, airway, gut and blood-vessel
// disease. See the taxonomy note on `conditions` below.

  description:
    'Dupixent is an injected interleukin-4 receptor alpha antagonist — a biologic — used for nine conditions driven by the same underlying type 2 inflammation, from moderate-to-severe eczema and asthma to COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype. Most adults inject it themselves every two weeks, which places it in the Part D pharmacy benefit rather than the Part B medical benefit.',
  usedFor: [
    'Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults and children 6 months and older whose disease is not adequately controlled by prescription creams',
    'Moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral-corticosteroid-dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years and older, as add-on maintenance treatment',
    'Inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in adults and children 12 and older, as add-on maintenance treatment',
    'Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) in adults and children 1 year and older weighing at least 15 kg',
    'Prurigo nodularis (PN) in adults',
    'Inadequately controlled COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype in adults, as add-on maintenance treatment',
    'Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in adults and children 2 and older who remain symptomatic on antihistamines',
    'Bullous pemphigoid (BP) in adults',
    'Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) in adults and children 6 and older with a history of sino-nasal surgery',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Dupixent is a brand-only biologic with no generic and no biosimilar, and Sanofi and Regeneron publish a list price of $4,193.03 per carton. Part D plans place it on a specialty tier, where you pay a percentage of that price rather than a flat copay, and usually behind prior authorization. Because it treats nine different conditions, the prior-authorization criteria your plan applies depend on which diagnosis it was prescribed for — a detail that decides more Dupixent claims than the price does.',
  medicareContext:
    'Dupixent is self-injected, so for almost everyone it is covered under Medicare Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan rather than Part B — usually on a specialty tier and typically with prior authorization tied to your specific diagnosis. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan can spread that across the year. Dupixent is not one of the drugs with a Medicare-negotiated price: it is absent from CMS\'s selected-drug lists for 2026, 2027 and 2028, so its price is set by the manufacturer and your plan, not by negotiation.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes — and Dupixent is the rare case on this site where a manufacturer program openly invites Medicare Part D beneficiaries and a charitable fund was actually open. The DUPIXENT MyWay Patient Assistance Program names Medicare Part D as a qualifying situation, and TotalAssist\'s eosinophilic esophagitis fund was accepting applications when we checked. The copay card, as always, excludes Medicare.',
    points: [
      'DUPIXENT MyWay Patient Assistance Program: the manufacturers state it "may be able to help" if you have no health insurance, are having difficulty paying, or have Medicare Part D. Eligibility, including household income, is assessed case by case — no income threshold is published — so the only way to know is to call.',
      'One program, two very different things: DUPIXENT MyWay is the free support program open to every patient (insurance help, nurse educators, refill reminders). The Patient Assistance Program is the separate, income-tested part inside it that helps with cost. Enrolling in MyWay does not mean you have applied for assistance.',
      'TotalAssist eosinophilic esophagitis fund: OPEN when we checked on August 26, 2026, with a $1,500 guaranteed and $2,000 maximum award. It lists Dupixent. This is the only open charitable fund we have found for any medication on this site — if EoE is your diagnosis, apply before the money runs out.',
      'The other four TotalAssist funds matching a Dupixent indication — atopic dermatitis, asthma, COPD and chronic spontaneous urticaria — were all closed to new applicants, as were HealthWell\'s asthma, COPD and urticaria funds.',
      'DUPIXENT MyWay Copay Card: commercially insured patients only. The terms state it is "not valid for prescriptions paid, in whole or in part, by Medicaid, Medicare, VA, DOD, TRICARE, or other federal or state programs."',
      'Two things people reasonably assume that are not true: Sanofi Patient Connection does not supply Dupixent (its medicine list does not include it), and HealthWell\'s AutoImmune – Medicare Access fund does not list Dupixent even though it lists other autoimmune biologics.',

  charitableSummary:
    'Dupixent has more charitable funds listing it than any medication on this site — eight across two foundations — because it treats nine conditions. On August 26, 2026 exactly one was open: TotalAssist\'s eosinophilic esophagitis fund, with a $1,500 guaranteed award. The other seven (TotalAssist atopic dermatitis, asthma, COPD and chronic spontaneous urticaria; HealthWell asthma, COPD – Medicare Access and urticaria) were closed to new applicants, and Good Days has no matching fund at all. Which fund you can use depends on the diagnosis Dupixent was prescribed for, not on the drug — so the first question to answer is which of the nine indications is on your prescription. Note also that HealthWell\'s AutoImmune – Medicare Access fund does not list Dupixent, so an eczema or prurigo nodularis diagnosis has no HealthWell route.',
  extraHelpNote:
    'Extra Help matters more than usual for Dupixent, because the manufacturer program publishes no income threshold and the charitable funds mostly depend on a fund balance. Extra Help depends on neither — and it lowers the cost of every covered drug you take, not just this one.',

Expect a specialty tier and prior authorization tied to your specific diagnosis. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and you can spread them across the year with the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can lower a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',

    {
      question: 'Is there a Dupixent patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Yes, and Medicare is named explicitly, which is unusual. The manufacturers write that "if you do not have health insurance, are experiencing difficulty paying for your DUPIXENT treatment or have Medicare Part D, the DUPIXENT MyWay Patient Assistance Program may be able to help." Eligibility including household income is decided case by case and no income threshold is published, so the only way to find out is to call 1-844-DUPIXENT (1-844-387-4936), option 1, Monday–Friday 8am–9pm ET, and ask about the Patient Assistance Program by name.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between DUPIXENT MyWay and the DUPIXENT MyWay Patient Assistance Program?',
      answer:
        'MyWay is the free support program available to every patient prescribed Dupixent — insurance guidance, a Case Manager, nurse-educator injection training, refill reminders and delivery scheduling. The Patient Assistance Program is a separate, income-tested program inside it that helps with the cost of the medication. Enrolling in MyWay does not enrol you in the Patient Assistance Program, so ask for it by name.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the DUPIXENT MyWay Copay Card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. The terms state the card is "not valid for prescriptions paid, in whole or in part, by Medicaid, Medicare, VA, DOD, TRICARE, or other federal or state programs, including any state pharmaceutical assistance programs." The manufacturers\' own eligibility checker enforces this: answer that you have government insurance and it declines you and refers you to the Patient Assistance Program. Federal anti-kickback rules are the reason, and they apply to every manufacturer copay card, not just this one.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Dupixent right now?',
      answer:
        'One, when we checked on August 26, 2026: TotalAssist\'s eosinophilic esophagitis fund was open, with a $1,500 guaranteed and $2,000 maximum award, and it lists Dupixent. Every other fund matching a Dupixent indication was closed — TotalAssist\'s atopic dermatitis, asthma, COPD and chronic spontaneous urticaria funds, and HealthWell\'s asthma, COPD – Medicare Access and urticaria funds. Good Days has no matching fund. Which one applies to you depends on your diagnosis, not on the drug.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does Sanofi Patient Connection provide Dupixent free?',
      answer:
        'No, and this is worth stating plainly because it is easy to assume otherwise. Sanofi Patient Connection is Sanofi\'s patient assistance program and it does supply a number of Sanofi medicines free to patients at or below 400% of the federal poverty level — but Dupixent is not on its medications-available list, which we read directly. For Dupixent the route is the DUPIXENT MyWay Patient Assistance Program instead.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Dupixent part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. Dupixent does not appear on CMS\'s selected-drug lists for 2026, 2027 or 2028. The 15 drugs selected for 2028 are Trulicity, Biktarvy, Orencia, Cosentyx, Erleada, Kisqali, Entyvio, Verzenio, Botox, Lenvima, Xolair, Rexulti, Xeljanz, Anoro Ellipta and Cimzia. Your Dupixent cost is therefore set by the manufacturers\' price and your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, which is why the $2,100 Part D cap and Extra Help matter more here.',

    {
      question: 'Is there a generic or biosimilar for Dupixent?',
      answer:
        'No. Dupilumab is a brand-only biologic with no generic and no biosimilar marketed in the United States, and the manufacturers publish a list price of $4,193.03 per carton. If cost is the problem, the routes on this page — the Patient Assistance Program, an open charitable fund matching your diagnosis, Extra Help, a formulary exception and a plan comparison in the fall — are where the movement is.
