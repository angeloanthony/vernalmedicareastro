// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Pradaxa (dabigatran etexilate) — Boehringer Ingelheim. Independently
// researched 2026-08-26. Batch 8 — a NEW slug.
//
// Pradaxa completes the anticoagulant set on this site alongside Eliquis and
// Xarelto, and the completion is the point. Eliquis and Xarelto were BOTH
// selected in Medicare's first negotiation cycle and have had negotiated prices
// in effect since January 1, 2026. Pradaxa was not selected — and it did not need
// to be, because dabigatran went generic: DailyMed lists 23 labelled dabigatran
// etexilate products across 19 distinct labelers, and the federal TrumpRx site
// prices generic dabigatran at $29.05.
//
// So the three direct oral anticoagulants a Medicare beneficiary is likely to be
// prescribed now reach affordability by two completely different mechanisms —
// negotiation for two of them, generic competition for the third. A reader who
// has been switched between them, which happens often, needs exactly this
// comparison and will not find it on a page about any one drug alone.
//
// Boehringer Ingelheim blocks automated access, as recorded for Spiriva, Ofev and
// Stiolto. The BI Cares Foundation's own therapy list names "Pradaxa® Capsules",
// but its terms could not be read, so the manufacturer card is `verify`. Unlike
// Stiolto, no PRADAXA savings-card terms PDF was served at the equivalent path —
// that request returned 404.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Pradaxa is a twice-daily anticoagulant — a blood thinner that slows the clotting proteins in blood, used for atrial fibrillation and for clots in the legs and lungs. It is one of three direct oral anticoagulants a Medicare beneficiary is commonly prescribed, and it is the one that became affordable by a different route from the other two: Eliquis and Xarelto got Medicare-negotiated prices, and Pradaxa got generics.',
  usedFor: [
    'Reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation',
    'Treating deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and reducing the risk of their recurrence',
    'Confirm which of these applies to your prescription with your prescriber — the label also covers prophylaxis after certain surgery',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Brand Pradaxa sits on a brand tier in most Part D plans, and anticoagulation often continues indefinitely, so cost-sharing repeats month after month. But the arithmetic here has changed completely: dabigatran is now thoroughly generic, with 23 labelled products from 19 different labelers on DailyMed, and the federal TrumpRx site prices generic dabigatran at $29.05. For most Medicare beneficiaries the generic, not a program, is the answer — and this page says so rather than padding a manufacturer section that could not be verified anyway.',
  medicareContext:
    'Pradaxa is a capsule you take yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, usually with brand Pradaxa on a brand tier and generic dabigatran on a much lower generic tier. It is not a Medicare-negotiated drug: CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Pradaxa or dabigatran row for 2026, 2027 or 2028 — unsurprising for a medicine that already has generic competition, since the program selects drugs without it. Two other direct oral anticoagulants WERE selected in the first cycle and have had negotiated prices in effect since January 1, 2026: Eliquis and Xarelto. So all three routinely-prescribed DOACs now have a Medicare cost story, reached two different ways. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Probably from the manufacturer, but we could not confirm the terms — and it matters less than usual, because generic dabigatran is widely available at a fraction of the brand price.

HealthWell runs no atrial fibrillation, stroke or clot fund at all, and neither does Good Days. That matters much less here than it would for a brand-only medicine, because the route that actually reduces what you pay for this medication needs no fund at all: generic dabigatran, from nineteen different labelers, priced at $29.05 on the federal TrumpRx site. Set a TotalAssist alert on the Stroke fund, but plan around the generic rather than waiting.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Pradaxa?',
      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Pradaxa, usually with brand Pradaxa on a brand tier and generic dabigatran on a much lower generic tier. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65, and a generic costs less still.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Pradaxa?',
      answer:
        'Yes, and it is thoroughly established: DailyMed lists 23 labelled dabigatran etexilate products across 19 distinct labelers, including Alembic, Apotex, Aurobindo, Dr. Reddy\'s and Mylan. The federal TrumpRx site prices generic dabigatran etexilate mesylate at $29.05 and carries no listing for brand Pradaxa. TotalAssist lists dabigatran on the same fund as the brand. Given that the manufacturer program\'s terms could not be verified, asking your prescriber and plan about the generic is by far the most reliable saving available.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Pradaxa part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No — and the reason is instructive. CMS\'s selected-drug file has no Pradaxa or dabigatran row for 2026, 2027 or 2028, because the negotiation program selects drugs that do not yet face generic competition, and dabigatran does. The other two direct oral anticoagulants took the other path: Eliquis and Xarelto were both selected in the first cycle and have had negotiated prices in effect since January 1, 2026. All three are now cheaper on Medicare than they were, by two different mechanisms.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Pradaxa patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Boehringer Ingelheim\'s foundation lists "Pradaxa® Capsules" among the therapies it offers, so a program almost certainly covers it — but we could not confirm its current terms. On August 26, 2026 every Boehringer Ingelheim patient-support page we tried returned a block page to automated access, and bicares.com served a placeholder. Rather than repeat figures from a sibling drug or a third-party site, this page records the gap. Before you make that call, price the generic: if generic dabigatran sits on your plan\'s generic tier, the program may be unnecessary.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Pradaxa right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Pradaxa on its Stroke fund and that fund was closed, with a $1,000 guaranteed and $1,500 maximum award. HealthWell runs no atrial fibrillation, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or anticoagulant fund of any kind, and Good Days has none either. Set a TotalAssist alert, but plan around the generic rather than waiting for a fund.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does Pradaxa differ from Brilinta, which is also called a blood thinner?',
      answer:
        'They are different kinds of medicine for different problems. Pradaxa is an anticoagulant: it slows the clotting proteins in blood, and it is used for atrial fibrillation and for clots in the legs and lungs. Brilinta is an antiplatelet: it stops platelets clumping in the arteries after a heart attack, a stent or an artery-blocking stroke. The phrase "blood thinner" covers both, but they are not interchangeable, and the assistance programs and charity funds that cover them are different too.
