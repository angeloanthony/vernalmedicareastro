  description:
    'Breztri Aerosphere is a maintenance inhaler that combines an inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide) with two long-acting bronchodilators (glycopyrrolate and formoterol) for COPD, and since April 2026 for asthma in people 12 and older. It is not a rescue inhaler.',
  usedFor: [
    'Maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults (160/9/4.8 mcg)',

    'Not for the relief of sudden breathing problems — a rescue inhaler is still needed',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Breztri is a brand-name inhaler with no generic: FDA\'s Orange Book lists only AstraZeneca\'s two products, with patents running as far as 2038. AstraZeneca lists the price at $684.43 for a 30-day supply (February 2026) and reports that people with Part D paid an average of $44.70 a month in 2025 — an average that hides the higher amounts paid before a deductible is met or on a non-preferred tier. Breztri is not in Medicare price negotiation for 2026 or 2027.',
  medicareContext:
    'Breztri Aerosphere is generally covered under Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans as a maintenance inhaler, often on a brand tier and sometimes behind prior authorization or step therapy.

      question: 'Is there a Breztri patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Yes. AstraZeneca\'s AZ&Me Prescription Savings Program lists Breztri and accepts Medicare beneficiaries who are not eligible for or enrolled in Extra Help, have no other insurance, and have adjusted gross income at or below 300% of the federal poverty level — $47,880 for one person or $64,920 for two in 2026. Approved patients receive Breztri free, in up to 90-day supplies. Apply at azandmeapp.com or call 1-800-292-6363.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Breztri Zero Pay card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. AstraZeneca\'s terms exclude anyone enrolled in Medicare Part D, Medicaid, Medigap, VA, DoD or TRICARE — and say you may not use the card even if you ask to be processed as a cash-paying patient. AstraZeneca directs Medicare patients who cannot afford Breztri to AZ&Me instead.',

    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Breztri right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Breztri under its COPD and Asthma funds, and HealthWell lists it under its COPD – Medicare Access fund, but all of those were closed to new applicants. Good Days has no lung fund. Sign up for TotalAssist and HealthWell alerts and check back — funds open when money arrives.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Breztri?',
      answer:
        'No. FDA\'s Orange Book lists only AstraZeneca\'s two Breztri products for this three-ingredient combination, with no generic application approved, and patents listed as far out as 2038. Ask your doctor whether a different maintenance inhaler on your plan\'s preferred tier would work for you if cost is the problem.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Breztri part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. Breztri is not on CMS\'s list of negotiated drugs for 2026 or 2027. (Trelegy Ellipta, a competing triple-therapy inhaler, has a negotiated price of $175 per 30-day supply starting January 1, 2027.) Your Breztri copay is set by your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if the fund is closed?',
      answer:
        'TotalAssist offers text, email or phone notifications when a fund opens, with no waitlist or queue; HealthWell offers alerts for each fund. While you wait, the routes that do not depend on a fund balance are AZ&Me, Extra Help, a formulary exception through your doctor, and a Part D plan comparison in the fall.
