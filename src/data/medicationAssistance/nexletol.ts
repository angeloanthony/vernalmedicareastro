// Nexletol (bempedoic acid) — Esperion Therapeutics. Independently researched
// 2026-08-26. Every program below was read on the official source cited with
// it. Batch 6 (spec §24 Phase 4 list, the closing four) — a NEW slug.
//
// The shape of this medication's assistance picture, in one line: the only
// manufacturer help Esperion publishes is a commercial co-pay card that
// excludes Medicare by name, and the one route that is actually OPEN to a
// Medicare beneficiary today is TotalAssist's Hypercholesterolemia fund.
//
// Research gap carried honestly: nexletol.com renders its co-pay and NEXSTEP
// pages client-side, so the patient-facing copy could not be read directly.
// The co-pay terms below come from Esperion's own HCP site, which publishes the
// full Terms & Conditions as static text, and from the card administrator's
// enrollment page. No manufacturer patient assistance program (free drug) is
// named anywhere on those pages — recorded as an honest negative, not omitted.

  description:
    'Nexletol is a once-daily cholesterol tablet for people who cannot take a statin, or cannot take enough of one. It blocks an enzyme called ATP-citrate lyase one step above the enzyme statins block, and because it is switched on in the liver rather than in muscle it is used by many people who could not tolerate statins.',
  usedFor: [
    'Reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events — cardiovascular death, heart attack, stroke or coronary revascularization — in adults at increased risk who are unable to take recommended statin therapy',
    'Lowering LDL cholesterol, with diet and exercise, in adults with hypercholesterolemia, including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)',
    'Used with other LDL-lowering therapies, or alone when they are not possible',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Nexletol is a brand-only tablet: DailyMed lists no generic bempedoic acid, only Esperion\'s Nexletol and the combination Nexlizet. Statins and ezetimibe are inexpensive generics, so Part D plans usually put Nexletol on a brand tier, often behind step therapy that asks you to try a statin first — which is the very thing a Nexletol candidate could not tolerate. Esperion\'s only published discount is a commercial co-pay card that excludes Medicare by name, so a Part D beneficiary pays the plan\'s brand cost-sharing until the annual out-of-pocket cap is reached.',
  medicareContext:
    'Nexletol is a self-administered tablet, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan rather than Part B — expect a brand tier, and check for prior authorization or step therapy on your plan\'s formulary. It has not been selected for Medicare price negotiation: neither Nexletol nor bempedoic acid appears anywhere in CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file for 2026, 2027 or 2028. What does apply is the Part D out-of-pocket cap ($2,100 in 2026), Medicare Extra Help if your income and resources are limited, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan if you want to spread the cost across the year.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes — but not from the manufacturer. Esperion publishes a co-pay card that excludes Medicare by name and no patient assistance program that gives Nexletol away, so for a Medicare beneficiary the open route is a charitable grant: TotalAssist\'s Hypercholesterolemia fund was accepting applications on August 26, 2026 and lists Nexletol, with a $1,900 guaranteed award.

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Nexletol?',
      answer:
        'Nexletol is a tablet you take yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan — typically on a brand tier, and often with prior authorization or step therapy asking you to try a statin first. Out-of-pocket Part D costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay down to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Nexletol patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'We could not find one. On August 26, 2026 the only manufacturer support Esperion published for Nexletol was the NEXSTEP program — a co-pay card for commercially insured patients and a Navigator access service — with no income-based program supplying the medication free. That is why the route for a Medicare beneficiary is a charitable grant: TotalAssist\'s Hypercholesterolemia fund was open and lists Nexletol.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Nexletol co-pay card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Esperion\'s terms limit the card to patients "not enrolled in any state-, federal-, or government-funded healthcare program, including but not limited to Medicare, Medicaid, Medigap, TRICARE… or the Department of Veterans Affairs," and add that you may not use it even if you ask to be processed as a commercial or discount-plan patient. Federal anti-kickback rules are why nearly every manufacturer copay card works this way.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Nexletol right now?',
      answer:
        'Yes, as of August 26, 2026. TotalAssist\'s Hypercholesterolemia fund was open, lists "Nexletol (Bempedoic Acid)" on its approved-medication list, and pays a $1,900 guaranteed award up to a $3,800 maximum for people with government insurance and income at or below 500% of the federal poverty level adjusted for local cost of living. HealthWell\'s Hypercholesterolemia – Medicare Access fund lists Nexletol too but was closed to new patients. Fund balances change without notice — check before you rely on it.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Nexletol?',
      answer:
        'Not on August 26, 2026. A DailyMed search for bempedoic acid returns only Esperion\'s Nexletol and the combination product Nexlizet — no generic labeller. If cost is the obstacle, ask your prescriber whether ezetimibe or another lipid-lowering medicine on your plan\'s preferred tier would work alongside or instead of Nexletol.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Nexletol part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price data file contains no row for Nexletol or bempedoic acid for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028. Your Nexletol cost is set by your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, not by a negotiated price.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if the fund closes before I apply?',
      answer:
        'TotalAssist offers text, email or automated-call notifications when a fund opens, and there is no waitlist or queue — the alert is what gets you in. HealthWell offers alerts on each fund page. While you wait, the routes that do not depend on a fund balance are Extra Help, a formulary exception through your doctor, the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan, and a Part D plan comparison in the fall.
