// Ranexa (ranolazine) — Gilead Sciences. Independently researched 2026-08-26.
// Batch 8 — a NEW slug.
//
// Ranexa is the registry's first ANTIANGINAL, and its first record for a
// medication whose manufacturer has effectively left the therapeutic area.
//
// The findings that shape this page:
//   • RANEXA.COM NO LONGER SERVES A SITE. The domain resolves in DNS but did not
//     complete an HTTPS connection on the checked date. There is no brand patient
//     site to look for a savings card on.
//   • GILEAD HAS NO CARDIOVASCULAR PROGRAM. Its Medication Access pages name no
//     Ranexa or ranolazine program, and the therapeutic areas it lists are
//     Virology, Oncology and Inflammation. Gilead Advancing Access presents HIV
//     treatment and prevention only.
//   • RANOLAZINE IS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVELY GENERIC MEDICATION IN THIS ENTIRE
//     BATCH: 35 labelled products across 31 distinct labelers on DailyMed.
//
// Taken together those three facts make a genuinely useful page rather than a
// thin one: the honest answer is that the brand has been superseded, the
// manufacturer has moved on, and a Medicare beneficiary should be asking their
// prescriber about generic ranolazine rather than hunting for a program.
//
// TAXONOMY: this record introduces `antianginal`. The label is unusual in stating
// no class at all — the Highlights call it only "Ranexa (ranolazine)
// extended-release tablets" — and the mechanism section says "The mechanism of
// action of ranolazine's antianginal effects has not been determined". The key is
// named for the effect the label does claim.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

    'Ranexa is a twice-daily extended-release tablet taken to reduce episodes of chronic angina — the chest pain that comes from reduced blood flow to the heart. It is unusual in two ways worth knowing: its own label says the mechanism behind its antianginal effect "has not been determined", and it does not lower heart rate or blood pressure the way most heart medicines do. It is also, by some distance, the most comprehensively genericised medication covered on this site.',
  usedFor: [
    'Treatment of chronic angina, used alone or alongside beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, antiplatelet therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers',

  whyCostly:
    'For most people on Medicare, brand Ranexa is not the medication they are actually dispensed, and that is the heart of this page. Ranolazine is available from 31 different labelers — 35 labelled products on DailyMed — so generic ranolazine typically sits on a low generic tier while brand Ranexa sits on a brand tier. If you are paying a brand-tier price for Ranexa, the question to ask is not which program can help but why you are on the brand at all.',
  medicareContext:
    'Ranexa is a tablet you take yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan — with brand Ranexa on a brand tier and generic ranolazine typically on a much lower generic tier. It is not a Medicare-negotiated drug: CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Ranexa or ranolazine row for 2026, 2027 or 2028, which is exactly what you would expect for a medicine with this much generic competition, since the negotiation program selects drugs that do not have it. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan can spread what you owe across the year. Realistically, though, none of those will be the thing that solves a Ranexa cost problem — the generic will.',

HealthWell runs no angina or coronary artery disease fund, and neither does Good Days.

Set the TotalAssist alert if the zip-code requirement fits you, and otherwise put your effort into the generic.',

    'Extra Help is worth applying for on its own merits — it lowers cost-sharing on every covered drug you take, and with full Extra Help a covered brand-name drug costs about $12.65 in 2026, with generics lower still.

      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover it, with brand Ranexa on a brand tier and generic ranolazine typically on a much lower generic tier. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65 — though for this medication the generic will usually make more difference than the subsidy.',

    {
      question: 'Is there a Ranexa patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No, and the reason is more informative than the answer. Gilead\'s Medication Access pages name no Ranexa or ranolazine program at all, and the therapeutic areas Gilead lists are Virology, Oncology and Inflammation — cardiovascular medicine is not among them. Gilead Advancing Access presents HIV treatment and prevention only. Beyond that, ranexa.com did not even complete an HTTPS connection when we checked, so there is no brand patient site where a savings card could be published. Gilead has moved on from this area, and the molecule went generic in the meantime.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Ranexa?',
      answer:
        'Yes — more than for any other medication covered on this site. DailyMed lists 35 labelled ranolazine products across 31 distinct labelers, including Ajanta, Sun Pharmaceutical, American Health Packaging and Vangard Labs. TotalAssist lists generic ranolazine on the same fund as the brand. If you are paying a brand-tier price for Ranexa, the most useful question is not which program can help but why you are on the brand rather than the generic.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does Ranexa work, and is it a blood thinner?',
      answer:
        'It is not a blood thinner, and it does not lower your heart rate or blood pressure. Ranexa is an antianginal — it reduces episodes of chest pain from reduced blood flow to the heart. Its label is unusually candid about the mechanism: "The mechanism of action of ranolazine\'s antianginal effects has not been determined", though it notes the drug "can inhibit the cardiac late sodium current" and has "anti-ischemic and antianginal effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure". The label expressly contemplates it being used alongside beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers and antiplatelet therapy rather than instead of them.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Ranexa right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026, and the options are narrower than for most medications. TotalAssist runs 146 funds and none of them is an angina fund; the only one whose approved-medication list includes Ranexa is the Coronary artery disease health equity fund, which was closed, pays $1,000 guaranteed up to $1,500, and additionally requires a home zip code in a designated social-vulnerability county. HealthWell runs no angina or coronary artery disease fund, and Good Days has none either.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Ranexa part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Ranexa or ranolazine row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028 — which is exactly what you would expect, because the negotiation program selects drugs that do not yet face generic competition, and ranolazine faces a great deal of it. Your cost is set by your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, and above all by whether you are dispensed the brand or the generic. See <a href="/prescription-drug-assistance.html">all prescription assistance options</a>.',
