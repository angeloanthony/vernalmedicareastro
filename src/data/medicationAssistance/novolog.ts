// NovoLog (insulin aspart) — Novo Nordisk. Independently researched 2026-08-26.
// Batch 8 — a NEW slug. D10 is resolved: one ordinary record per insulin brand.
//
// NovoLog is the ONLY insulin Medicare has ever negotiated a price for, and the
// negotiation story has a second half that almost nobody reports:
//
//   • CMS selected NOVOLOG / NOVOLOG FLEXPEN / NOVOLOG PENFILL / FIASP /
//     FIASP FLEXTOUCH / FIASP PENFILL (insulin aspart, human) for initial price
//     applicability year 2026. The maximum fair price is $119.00 per 30-day
//     equivalent supply, effective 01/01/2026, with an inflation-adjusted $122.22
//     recorded for 01/01/2027.
//   • BUT every NDC in the file also carries Type of Update "Deselect" and the
//     remark "NDC deselected from negotiation program with end date of
//     12/31/2026", as of 04/20/2026. The negotiated price runs through 2026 and
//     then stops.
//
// THIS FIGURE IS PRODUCT-SPECIFIC AND MUST NEVER BE GENERALISED. It applies to
// Novo Nordisk's insulin aspart products and to nothing else — not to Tresiba
// (insulin degludec, same manufacturer), not to Lantus or Toujeo (Sanofi
// glargine), and not to Lyumjev (Lilly lispro-aabc). No other insulin appears on
// any CMS selected-drug list for 2026, 2027 or 2028.
//
// Second differentiator: insulin aspart now has real biosimilar competition —
// DailyMed labels MERILOG (insulin aspart-szjj), KIRSTY (insulin aspart-xjhz) and
// GARZULYS alongside NovoLog, from 10 distinct labelers. Merilog is a Sanofi
// product, so a Novo Nordisk patient's biosimilar route runs through a different
// manufacturer's assistance program entirely.
//
// Novo Nordisk's PAP also has the most unusual insurance rule in this batch: it
// requires you to have Medicare or no insurance, and EXCLUDES commercial cover.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  manufacturer: 'Novo Nordisk',
  conditions: ['diabetes'],
  drugClass: ['insulin'],
  description:
    'NovoLog is a rapid-acting mealtime insulin — you take it around meals to cover the rise in blood sugar that food causes, rather than for background coverage between meals. It is the only insulin for which Medicare has ever negotiated a price directly with the manufacturer, and understanding what that negotiation did, and when it stops, is the most useful thing on this page.',
  usedFor: [
    'Improving blood sugar control in adults and children with diabetes mellitus, taken around mealtimes',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Mealtime insulin is used several times a day, every day, so the quantities add up faster than for a once-daily background insulin. Two things pull NovoLog\'s cost down and neither applies to the other insulins on this site. First, Medicare negotiated a maximum fair price of $119.00 per 30-day equivalent supply, in effect through 2026. Second, insulin aspart now has genuine biosimilar competition: DailyMed labels Merilog, Kirsty and Garzulys alongside NovoLog, from ten different labelers in total. Novo Nordisk also sells NovoLog for $35 cash through the federal TrumpRx site.',
  medicareContext:
    'NovoLog is covered under Medicare Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, and under federal law a covered insulin costs no more than $35 for a month\'s supply with no deductible applied — a rule that applies to insulins generally; our <a href="/insulin-cost-medicare-vernal.html">insulin cost guide</a> covers it across products. What is unique to NovoLog is the negotiation. CMS selected NovoLog, NovoLog FlexPen, NovoLog PenFill, Fiasp, Fiasp FlexTouch and Fiasp PenFill — all insulin aspart products — for initial price applicability year 2026, and set a maximum fair price of $119.00 per 30-day equivalent supply effective January 1, 2026, with $122.22 recorded for January 1, 2027. But the same CMS file records every one of those NDCs as deselected from the negotiation program with an end date of December 31, 2026. So the negotiated price applies for 2026 and then ends. This figure belongs to Novo Nordisk\'s insulin aspart products and to nothing else: no other insulin — not Tresiba, not Lantus, not Toujeo, not Lyumjev — appears on any CMS selected-drug list for 2026, 2027 or 2028, and this price does not transfer to them.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes, and Novo Nordisk\'s program has the most unusual insurance rule in this batch: it requires you to have Medicare or no insurance, and turns commercial insurance into a disqualifier. NovoLog is also the only insulin Medicare has negotiated a price for — $119.00 per 30-day equivalent supply — though the CMS file shows that negotiated price ending after 2026.',
    points: [
      'Novo Nordisk Patient Assistance Program: NovoLog is on its product list. "Have Medicare or no insurance (Note: If you have private or commercial insurance, you are not eligible for the PAP)" — the reverse of most manufacturer programs.',
      'For Medicare patients on Novo Nordisk insulins: household income at or below 400% of the federal poverty level. Below 150% FPL you must provide proof of denial for Part D Extra Help.',
      'Extra Help enrollees are excluded: the program requires you not be enrolled in or qualify for Medicaid, Medicare Low-Income Subsidy or VA benefits, and asks for a copy of your denial if you are eligible for either.',

      'Biosimilars now exist: Merilog, Kirsty and Garzulys are labelled insulin aspart products, and TotalAssist lists them on the same fund as NovoLog.',
      'Charitable grants: TotalAssist\'s Type 2 diabetes funds both list NovoLog and both were closed ($1,500 guaranteed / $2,000 maximum). HealthWell\'s Type 2 Diabetes fund was closed. Good Days has no diabetes fund.',

As with every insulin on this site, these are type 2 funds — and NovoLog is a mealtime insulin widely used in type 1 diabetes, so a substantial share of the people reading this page have no charitable route on these three foundations. The useful consequence is that the routes that do not depend on a fund balance matter more here: the Novo Nordisk program, which is unusual in requiring Medicare rather than excluding it; the biosimilars, which the funds treat identically to the brand; and your plan\'s $35 insulin cost-sharing.',

    'For NovoLog, Extra Help and the manufacturer program are in direct tension, and you should know which you are choosing. Novo Nordisk requires that you "not be enrolled in or qualify for" Medicare Extra Help, and Medicare beneficiaries below 150% of the federal poverty level must supply proof that Extra Help turned them down. So you cannot hold both. In most cases Extra Help is the stronger option: it lowers cost-sharing on every covered drug you take rather than one, it does not require annual re-approval by a manufacturer, and it cannot be withdrawn when a program\'s rules change. Apply for Extra Help first and treat the Novo Nordisk program as the route for people it turns down — which is precisely the sequence Novo Nordisk\'s own denial-letter requirement implies.',

Our <a href="/insulin-cost-medicare-vernal.html">insulin cost guide</a> explains how that works across products. NovoLog is also the only insulin for which Medicare has negotiated a price directly with the manufacturer.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the Medicare negotiated price for NovoLog, and does it still apply?',
      answer:
        'CMS set a maximum fair price of $119.00 per 30-day equivalent supply for Novo Nordisk\'s insulin aspart products — NovoLog, NovoLog FlexPen, NovoLog PenFill, Fiasp, Fiasp FlexTouch and Fiasp PenFill — effective January 1, 2026, with an inflation-adjusted $122.22 recorded for January 1, 2027. But the same CMS data file records every one of those NDCs as deselected from the negotiation program with an end date of December 31, 2026. So the negotiated price applies during 2026 and then ends. In practice what you pay is your plan\'s cost-sharing, and for a covered insulin that is capped at $35 a month, which is lower than the negotiated price.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does the NovoLog negotiated price apply to my other insulin?',
      answer:
        'No, and this is worth being firm about. The $119.00 maximum fair price applies to Novo Nordisk\'s insulin aspart products and to nothing else. Tresiba (insulin degludec) is made by the same company and is not on any CMS selected-drug list. Neither is Lantus or Toujeo (Sanofi\'s insulin glargine), nor Lyumjev (Lilly\'s insulin lispro-aabc). NovoLog and Fiasp are the only insulins CMS has ever selected, for 2026, 2027 or 2028.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a NovoLog patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Yes, and it is built the opposite way round from most. Novo Nordisk\'s rule is: "Have Medicare or no insurance (Note: If you have private or commercial insurance, you are not eligible for the PAP)." Having Medicare qualifies you rather than disqualifying you. For Medicare patients on Novo Nordisk insulins, household income must be at or below 400% of the federal poverty level. The significant catch is Extra Help: you must not be enrolled in or qualify for it, and if you are eligible you must supply a copy of your denial. Approved patients get up to a 120-day supply, shipped to a licensed healthcare professional.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I have both Extra Help and the Novo Nordisk program?',
      answer:
        'No. Novo Nordisk requires that you "not be enrolled in or qualify for any other federal, state, or government program such as Medicaid, Medicare Low-Income Subsidy (LIS, or Extra Help Program), or Veterans Affairs (VA) Benefits", and beneficiaries below 150% of the federal poverty level must provide proof that Extra Help denied them. For most people Extra Help is the better of the two — it applies to every covered drug you take, not just your insulin. Apply for <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Extra Help</a> first and treat the manufacturer program as the fallback if you are turned down.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a biosimilar for NovoLog?',
      answer:
        'Yes, several. DailyMed lists 20 labelled insulin aspart products across ten labelers, including Merilog (insulin aspart-szjj), Kirsty (insulin aspart-xjhz) and Garzulys alongside Novo Nordisk\'s NovoLog and Fiasp, plus an unbranded insulin aspart. TotalAssist lists Merilog and Kirsty on the same Type 2 diabetes fund as NovoLog, so switching would not cost you fund eligibility. One thing to note: Merilog is a Sanofi product, so if you switch to it your manufacturer assistance route changes companies too.
