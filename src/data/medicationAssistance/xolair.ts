// Xolair (omalizumab) — Genentech. Independently researched 2026-08-26.
// Batch 8 — a NEW slug.
//
// Xolair was the medication the project repeatedly deferred, and the research
// justifies the page on its own terms rather than on the deferral.
//
// 1. THE GENENTECH PATIENT FOUNDATION IS UNLIKE EVERY OTHER PAP IN THIS REGISTRY.
//    Its income limits are FLAT DOLLARS, not a percentage of the federal poverty
//    level: under $75,000 for one person, rising by $25,000 per additional
//    household member. And it has a third qualifying route that no other program
//    here offers — "I have insurance that covers my Genentech medicine, but the
//    out-of-pocket maximum set by my health insurance plan is more than 7.5% of
//    my yearly income." That 7.5% test is the door a Medicare beneficiary walks
//    through, and it is the single most useful fact on this page.
//
// 2. XOLAIR IS SELECTED FOR MEDICARE NEGOTIATION (IPAY 2028) AND CARRIES A PART B
//    BILLING CODE. The CMS file lists Xolair with HCPCS J2357 — a Part B code —
//    while the label also supports self-administration by prefilled syringe or
//    autoinjector. Which benefit pays for your doses genuinely depends on how and
//    where you receive them, and that changes which assistance applies.
//
// 3. TAXONOMY — the question the project reserved this medication to settle.
//    DECISION: conditions ['respiratory'], drugClass ['biologic']. NO new key.
//    Applying the Ofev test — "topic similarity is not enough to create a new
//    condition key; incorrect program matching is" — the evidence points the
//    other way from Ofev:
//      • Ofev needed `lung-disease` because tagging it `respiratory` would have
//        matched it to COPD and asthma funds that DO NOT list it. Wrong matching.
//      • Xolair tagged `respiratory` matches the TotalAssist Asthma fund and the
//        HealthWell Asthma fund, both of which DO list Xolair. Correct matching.
//    The label's other indications (chronic spontaneous urticaria, nasal polyps,
//    IgE-mediated food allergy) are carried in `usedFor` and, for CSU, as an
//    explicit charitable program entry — so the reader loses nothing. Adding an
//    urticaria or allergy key would create a browse view holding one medication
//    and would not change a single fund match.
//    `autoimmune` was considered and REJECTED: it would match Xolair to
//    HealthWell's AutoImmune – Medicare Access fund, a different diagnosis set
//    that does not list it. That would be exactly the incorrect matching the rule
//    forbids.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Xolair is an injected biologic — the label calls it "an anti-IgE antibody" — that blocks immunoglobulin E, the antibody behind allergic reactions. It is unusual among the medications on this site for treating four quite different conditions, and that matters practically: the charitable fund you qualify for, and the size of its award, depend on which of them you were prescribed it for.',
  usedFor: [
    'Moderate to severe persistent asthma in adults and children aged 6 and over with a positive allergy test and symptoms not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids',
    'Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adults, as add-on maintenance treatment when nasal corticosteroids have not worked well enough',
    'IgE-mediated food allergy in adults and children aged 1 and over, to reduce allergic reactions including anaphylaxis after accidental exposure — used alongside food allergen avoidance, not instead of it',
    'Chronic spontaneous urticaria (long-lasting hives with no identified cause) in people aged 12 and over who remain symptomatic despite antihistamines',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Xolair is a brand-only biologic with no generic and no biosimilar — DailyMed labels exactly one omalizumab product. Doses are weight- and IgE-based, so two people on Xolair can be prescribed very different quantities, and the cost follows. Where the drug lands on your Medicare coverage adds a second variable: the CMS negotiation file lists Xolair with a Part B billing code, while the label also supports self-injection at home with a prefilled syringe or autoinjector. Part B and Part D share costs differently, so the same medicine can produce quite different bills depending on how you receive it.',
  medicareContext:
    'Xolair can reach you through either Medicare benefit, and this is the first thing to establish. If you self-inject at home with a prefilled syringe or autoinjector, it is normally a Part D or Medicare Advantage drug-plan matter, generally on a specialty tier with prior authorization. If it is administered in a clinic or infusion setting, it may be billed under Part B — CMS\'s own negotiation file lists Xolair with HCPCS code J2357, which is a Part B code. That distinction changes your cost-sharing, and it changes which help applies: Extra Help is a Part D subsidy and does nothing for a Part B coinsurance, whereas a Medigap policy or a Medicare Savings Program can. Ask your prescriber\'s office which benefit your doses run through before planning around a figure. Xolair is also one of the 15 drugs CMS selected for the third negotiation cycle, with any negotiated price effective January 1, 2028; no price has been published yet.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes, and through a route most manufacturer programs do not offer. The Genentech Patient Foundation covers Xolair and lets people who already have insurance qualify if their plan\'s out-of-pocket maximum exceeds 7.5% of their yearly income — which is how a Medicare beneficiary gets in. Its income limits are flat dollar figures, not percentages of the poverty level. Every applicable charitable fund was closed.',

      'Income limits are flat dollars: under $75,000 for one person, under $100,000 for two, under $125,000 for three, under $150,000 for four, adding $25,000 per additional person. No FPL percentage is involved.',

  charitableSummary:
    'Xolair\'s charitable picture is shaped by its four indications, and it pays to know which one is yours. TotalAssist covers it on the Asthma fund ($1,200 guaranteed, $3,500 maximum), on the Asthma health equity fund at the same level, and on the Chronic spontaneous urticaria fund at $2,600 guaranteed and $5,200 maximum — more than double, for the same medicine. HealthWell mirrors this with an Asthma fund and a Urticaria fund. Every one of those funds was closed on August 26, 2026, and Good Days has none. Two indications — nasal polyps and IgE-mediated food allergy — have no charitable fund on any of the three foundations, which is a real gap rather than an oversight in our checking. So: set your alert on the fund that matches your diagnosis, not the first one you find, and treat the Genentech Patient Foundation as the primary route, because its 7.5% out-of-pocket test does not depend on a fund balance.',
  extraHelpNote:
    'Extra Help is worth applying for, but be clear about what it can and cannot do for this medication. Extra Help is a Part D subsidy: if you self-inject Xolair at home and it runs through your drug plan, it lowers your cost-sharing, and with full Extra Help a covered brand-name drug costs about $12.65 in 2026. If your Xolair is administered in a clinic and billed under Part B, Extra Help does not touch that coinsurance — a Medigap policy or a Medicare Savings Program is the tool for the Part B side. Find out which benefit pays for your doses first; it determines which of these is worth your time.

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Xolair?',
      answer:
        'Yes, but through one of two different benefits, and which one matters. If you self-inject at home with a prefilled syringe or autoinjector, Xolair is normally covered by Medicare Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, generally on a specialty tier with prior authorization. If it is administered in a clinic, it may be billed under Part B — CMS\'s own negotiation file lists Xolair with HCPCS code J2357, a Part B code. Ask your prescriber\'s office which applies to you, because it changes your cost-sharing and which assistance is useful.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How can I qualify for the Genentech Patient Foundation if I already have Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Through Genentech\'s third qualifying route, which is written for insured people: "I have insurance that covers my Genentech medicine, but the out-of-pocket maximum set by my health insurance plan is more than 7.5% of my yearly income." So the test is not whether you have coverage — it is whether your coverage still leaves you exposed to more than 7.5% of your income. Alongside that, your total yearly income must be under $75,000 for one person, $100,000 for two, $125,000 for three or $150,000 for four, plus $25,000 for each additional person. Those are flat dollar limits, not percentages of the federal poverty level.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why does the charity award for Xolair differ so much between funds?',
      answer:
        'Because the funds are built around diagnoses, not medicines, and Xolair treats several. TotalAssist lists Xolair on its Asthma fund, which pays $1,200 guaranteed up to $3,500, and on its Chronic spontaneous urticaria fund, which pays $2,600 guaranteed up to $5,200 — more than double, for exactly the same drug. If you were prescribed Xolair for chronic hives, applying to the asthma fund would leave money on the table. Set your alert on the fund that matches your diagnosis.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Xolair part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'It has been selected, but no price exists yet. Xolair is one of the 15 drugs on CMS\'s selected-drug list for initial price applicability year 2028, listed with HCPCS code J2357. Selection means negotiation happens first and any resulting maximum fair price takes effect January 1, 2028. CMS\'s published data file carries an empty price column for Xolair today, so anyone quoting you a negotiated Xolair price now is quoting something CMS has not published.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic or biosimilar for Xolair?',
      answer:
        'No. DailyMed lists exactly one labelled omalizumab product — Genentech\'s Xolair. There is no generic and no biosimilar, so there is no lower-tier version to ask about. That is part of why the Genentech Patient Foundation\'s 7.5% route matters so much here: for a biologic with no competition, the structural routes are the ones that move money.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Xolair right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist\'s Asthma fund, Asthma health equity fund and Chronic spontaneous urticaria fund were all closed, and HealthWell\'s Asthma and Urticaria funds were closed too. Good Days runs no applicable fund. Worth knowing: two of Xolair\'s four indications — nasal polyps and IgE-mediated food allergy — have no fund on any of the three foundations at all, so if that is your diagnosis the Genentech Patient Foundation is effectively the route.
