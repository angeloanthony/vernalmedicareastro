// Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 units/mL) — Sanofi. Independently researched
// 2026-08-26. Batch 8 — a NEW slug. D10 is resolved: one ordinary record per
// insulin brand.
//
// Toujeo shares Sanofi's assistance layer with Lantus, and this record does not
// pretend otherwise. What it adds is genuinely Toujeo-specific:
//
//  • CONCENTRATION. Toujeo is insulin glargine at 300 units/mL — three times the
//    concentration of Lantus at 100 units/mL. The same number of units occupies a
//    third of the volume, so a pen lasts longer at the same dose. That changes the
//    arithmetic of any per-pack price, including the $35 offers, and it is the one
//    thing a reader comparing the two Sanofi glargines actually needs.
//  • THE ONLY PUBLISHED DISCOUNT DEPTH IN THIS BATCH. The federal TrumpRx site
//    lists Toujeo at $35.00 against a stated former price of $428.57 — a 92%
//    reduction, and the only place in this expansion where a government site
//    publishes both the before and after figures for a medication.
//  • AN UNBRANDED EQUIVALENT AT THE SAME STRENGTH. DailyMed labels an
//    "INSULIN GLARGINE U-300" alongside Toujeo and Toujeo Max, and Sanofi Patient
//    Connection lists that unbranded U-300 as a separate covered product.
//
// The Valyou TrOOP trade-off applies here exactly as it does to Lantus and is
// restated rather than cross-referenced, because a reader landing on this page
// should not have to visit another to learn it.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  drugClass: ['insulin'],
  description:
    'Toujeo is Sanofi\'s concentrated long-acting insulin — the same molecule as Lantus, insulin glargine, but at 300 units per millilitre instead of 100. A given dose therefore takes up a third of the volume, which is why a Toujeo pen holds more units than a Lantus pen of the same size. If you are comparing prices between the two, that concentration difference is the thing that makes a straight per-pen comparison misleading.',

    'Improving blood sugar control in children aged 6 years and older with diabetes — confirm the age range that applies to your prescription with your prescriber',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Insulin is a lifelong daily expense, so small monthly differences compound over years. For Toujeo specifically, two published figures set the boundaries. The federal TrumpRx site lists Toujeo at $35.00 against a former price of $428.57 — a 92% reduction, and the clearest illustration on this site of how far insulin list prices have moved. And an unbranded insulin glargine at the same 300 units/mL strength is now labelled on DailyMed, which gives you something to compare Toujeo against at equal concentration rather than against a 100 units/mL product.',
  medicareContext:
    'Toujeo is covered under Medicare Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan. Under federal law a covered insulin costs no more than $35 for a month\'s supply under a Medicare drug plan, with no deductible applied — a rule that applies to insulins generally rather than to Toujeo specifically; our <a href="/insulin-cost-medicare-vernal.html">insulin cost guide</a> covers how it works across products. What is specific to Toujeo: it is not a Medicare-negotiated drug (CMS\'s selected-drug file has no Toujeo, Lantus or glargine row for 2026, 2027 or 2028), and because it is a concentrated product your plan may treat it differently from 100 units/mL glargine on its formulary — so check the tier for the exact product you are prescribed, not for "insulin glargine" generally. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes — Sanofi Patient Connection covers Toujeo for people at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, though it publishes no Medicare rule. Sanofi also sells Toujeo for $35 cash outside insurance, and the federal TrumpRx site shows that price against a former $428.57. The catch is the same one that applies to all Sanofi insulins: cash spending does not count toward your Part D out-of-pocket cap. Both diabetes charitable funds were closed.',
    points: [
      'Sanofi Patient Connection: Toujeo is on its medication list, as is a separate unbranded Insulin Glargine U-300. Income at or below 400% FPL — $63,840 for one person in 2026. NO Medicare rule is published, so call and ask.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Toujeo?',
      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans cover Toujeo, and under federal law a covered insulin costs no more than $35 for a month\'s supply with no deductible applied. Check your plan\'s tier for the exact Toujeo product rather than for insulin glargine generally, because concentrated insulins are sometimes placed differently. Our <a href="/insulin-cost-medicare-vernal.html">insulin cost guide</a> covers how the cap works across products.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between Toujeo and Lantus?',
      answer:
        'They are the same medicine at different concentrations. Both are insulin glargine, but Lantus is 100 units per millilitre and Toujeo is 300 units per millilitre. The practical consequence is that a Toujeo pen delivers three times as many units for the same volume of liquid, so comparing the price of one pen against the other is misleading — compare cost per unit instead. For assistance purposes they are treated identically: the same Sanofi programs, the same income limits, and both appear on the same charitable fund lists.',
    },
    {
      question: 'TrumpRx shows Toujeo at $35, down from $428.57. Is that a good deal on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'It is a real price, but on Medicare it is often a lateral move rather than a saving. A covered insulin under a Medicare drug plan is already capped at $35 a month with no deductible applied — the same figure — and that spending counts toward your $2,100 annual out-of-pocket cap. Sanofi\'s cash terms say you "may not seek to have your out-of-pocket costs... count toward your deductible, true-out-of-pocket (TrOOP), maximum out-of-pocket (MOOP), or any other out-of-pocket caps." So the cash route matters mainly if your plan does not cover Toujeo at all.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Toujeo patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Sanofi Patient Connection covers Toujeo and has a clear income test — household income at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, which is $63,840 for one person in the 48 states and DC in 2026. But it publishes no Medicare rule: none of its eligibility criteria mentions Medicare at all. Call 1-888-847-4877 and ask whether Medicare Part D enrollees may apply, and whether being prescribed Toujeo when your plan prefers a different glargine counts as lacking "access to the prescribed product".',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic version of Toujeo?',
      answer:
        'There is an unbranded equivalent at the same strength. DailyMed labels an "Insulin Glargine U-300" alongside Toujeo and Toujeo Max, and Sanofi Patient Connection lists that unbranded U-300 as a covered product in its own right. There are also several 100 units/mL glargine products — Basaglar, Semglee, Rezvoglar and Langlara — but those are a different concentration, so switching to one is a dosing conversation with your prescriber rather than a straight substitution.',

    {
      question: 'Is Toujeo part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Toujeo, Lantus or insulin glargine row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028. The only insulin CMS has selected is Novo Nordisk\'s insulin aspart, sold as NovoLog and Fiasp — a different product from a different manufacturer, and its negotiated price has nothing to do with Toujeo.
