// Praluent (alirocumab) — Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Independently researched
// 2026-08-26. Every program below was read on the official source cited with
// it. Batch 5 (spec §24 Phase 4 list) — a NEW slug.
//
// Three things the research settled that the legacy data had wrong or vague:
//   • Regeneron, not Sanofi, markets Praluent in the U.S. and runs its
//     assistance program. Sanofi Patient Connection's own medications list
//     (22 medicines) does not include Praluent.
//   • Regeneron's only published patient-assistance form is a RE-ENROLLMENT
//     form that requires prior enrollment; no new-patient form exists on any
//     reachable Regeneron page, and the form has no Medicare pathway.
//   • The cash route is TrumpRx.gov ($225 a month against a $537.21 list
//     price), with terms that let a Medicare enrollee buy outside Part D.
// The MyPRALUENT copay card's dollar terms live behind a login and could not
// be read; only its government-payer exclusion is documented, so the card is
// recorded as 'verify' with no dollar figure — never a borrowed one.

  description:
    'Praluent is an injectable PCSK9 inhibitor — a monoclonal antibody given every two or four weeks by pre-filled pen — that lowers LDL cholesterol and reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke in adults at increased cardiovascular risk. Regeneron now markets it in the United States and runs its assistance programs.',
  usedFor: [
    'Reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease death, heart attack, stroke or unstable angina requiring hospitalization) in adults at increased risk for these events',
    'Lowering LDL cholesterol, with diet and exercise, in adults with hypercholesterolemia, in adults and children 8 and older with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and in adults with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'The federal TrumpRx site shows an original price of $537.21 for two Praluent pens (a month\'s supply at every-two-weeks dosing). Part D plans usually place PCSK9 inhibitors on a specialty tier with prior authorization requiring a statin trial, so the coinsurance can be substantial until the $2,100 annual cap. Regeneron\'s only published patient-assistance form is for re-enrollment, and the copay card excludes Medicare.',
  medicareContext:
    'Praluent is a self-injected pen, so under Medicare\'s general rule it is a Part D drug, not Part B — no CMS page names Praluent specifically. Alirocumab has not been selected for Medicare price negotiation for 2026, 2027 or 2028 (no PCSK9 inhibitor has). Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. Since April 2026 Regeneron also sells Praluent for $225 a month through TrumpRx.gov; a Medicare enrollee may buy at that price, but only outside their plan — the money does not count toward the Part D deductible or cap.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes, with a clear order of priority. TotalAssist\'s Hypercholesterolemia fund was open on August 26, 2026 and lists Praluent, for people with government insurance and income at or below 500% of the poverty level. The $225-a-month TrumpRx price is open to Medicare enrollees who pay cash outside their plan. Regeneron\'s MyPRALUENT patient assistance program is documented only for re-enrollment and requires having no pharmacy coverage, so it is not a realistic route for someone on Part D. The copay card excludes Medicare, HealthWell\'s cholesterol fund was closed, and Good Days has no cholesterol fund.',

      'TrumpRx cash price: $225.00 for two pens (58% off $537.21). Medicare enrollees may use it, but must not seek reimbursement or count the cost toward their Part D deductible or out-of-pocket limit.',

      question: 'Can Medicare help pay for Praluent?',
      answer:
        'Praluent is a self-injected pen, so it falls under Medicare Part D rather than Part B. Most Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans cover it on a specialty tier with prior authorization, and Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can lower a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65. See our <a href="/medicare-drug-coverage.html">drug coverage guides</a> for how formularies work.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Praluent patient assistance program?',
      answer:
        'Regeneron runs the MyPRALUENT Patient Assistance Program, but the only form it publishes (checked August 26, 2026) is a re-enrollment form that requires prior enrollment, no pharmacy coverage and household income no more than $47,880 for one person or $64,920 for two. Sanofi Patient Connection does not cover Praluent — it is not on that program\'s medications list. Call 1-844-772-5836 to ask whether new enrollment is open.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the MyPRALUENT copay card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Regeneron\'s reimbursement form requires you to certify that your prescription "was not paid in whole or in part by Medicare, Medicaid, or any federal or state programs." Federal anti-kickback rules are the reason manufacturer copay cards exclude government insurance.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the $225 TrumpRx price, and can I use it with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Since April 2026 Regeneron sells Praluent through TrumpRx.gov for $225.00 a month (two pens), against an original price of $537.21. You may use it if you have Medicare, but the terms require that you not ask your plan to reimburse you, not count the cost toward your deductible or out-of-pocket limit, and tell your insurer you bought outside the plan if asked. It makes sense only when $225 is less than your plan coinsurance and you are far from the $2,100 cap.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Praluent right now?',
      answer:
        'Yes — when we checked on August 26, 2026, TotalAssist\'s Hypercholesterolemia fund was open: $1,900 guaranteed, up to $3,800, for people with Medicare, Medicaid or TRICARE and income at or below 500% of the federal poverty level. Praluent Pen is on its list. HealthWell\'s cholesterol fund lists Praluent but was closed, and Good Days has no cholesterol program.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Praluent a Medicare negotiated-price drug?',
      answer:
        'No. Alirocumab was not selected for the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program for 2026, 2027 or 2028 — no PCSK9 inhibitor was. Your cost depends on your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, up to the $2,100 cap.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can my doctor\'s office apply for me?',
      answer:
        'For TotalAssist and HealthWell you (the patient) apply, and the foundation verifies the diagnosis with your provider. For the MyPRALUENT program your prescriber completes the prescribing section of the form. Your doctor\'s office also handles the prior authorization Part D plans usually require for a PCSK9 inhibitor. Vernal Medicare can help you work through the options, free.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if the fund is closed?',
      answer:
        'TotalAssist offers text, email or phone notifications with no waitlist or queue, and HealthWell says closed funds reopen as funding is replenished. While you wait: apply for Extra Help, compare the TrumpRx price against your plan cost, ask your doctor about Repatha or a formulary exception, and compare Part D plans in the fall.
