// Inpefa (sotagliflozin) — Lexicon Pharmaceuticals. Independently researched
// 2026-08-26. Batch 8 — a NEW slug.
//
// Inpefa is the registry's first record from a small, single-product
// manufacturer, and the assistance landscape looks different for that reason
// alone. Lexicon publishes a copay program with a specific figure ($10) and a
// specific cap (13 uses a year) but no income-tested free-drug program with
// published criteria — only a sentence saying help "may" exist. That is a
// different shape from the big-manufacturer foundations, and it is worth a
// reader knowing before they spend an afternoon looking for one.
//
// TAXONOMY NOTE. Inpefa carries `heart` ONLY, and the reasoning matters:
//   • The label's own class statement is "INPEFA is a sodium-glucose cotransporter
//     2 (SGLT2) inhibitor", so `sglt2` is exactly right on the class axis. No new
//     class key is warranted.
//   • On the CONDITION axis, the indication is to "reduce the risk of
//     cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart
//     failure visit" in adults with heart failure OR with type 2 diabetes, chronic
//     kidney disease and other cardiovascular risk factors. It is a cardiovascular
//     outcomes drug; it has no glycaemic indication.
//   • Tagging it `diabetes` would match it to the TotalAssist Type 2 diabetes
//     fund — and that fund's approved-medication list does NOT include Inpefa.
//     That is precisely the incorrect program matching the Ofev rule forbids.
//     Inpefa IS on the Heart failure and Stroke funds, which `heart` matches.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Inpefa is a once-daily tablet taken to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and heart-failure hospitalisation. It belongs to the same SGLT2 family as Farxiga and Jardiance, but it is licensed as a heart medicine rather than a blood-sugar one — a distinction that decides which charitable funds you can apply to, and one that this page gets right because the funds themselves do.',
  usedFor: [
    'Reducing the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalisation for heart failure and urgent heart-failure visits in adults with heart failure',
    'The same risk reduction in adults with type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and other cardiovascular risk factors',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Inpefa is a brand-only tablet with no generic — DailyMed lists a single labelled sotagliflozin product — taken indefinitely once started. It also comes from a small manufacturer with one marketed product, which shapes the help available: Lexicon publishes a copay card with a firm figure but no income-tested free-drug program with published criteria, so there is less of a safety net behind the card than there would be with a large manufacturer.',
  medicareContext:
    'Inpefa is a tablet you take yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, usually on a brand tier. It is not a Medicare-negotiated drug: CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Inpefa or sotagliflozin row for 2026, 2027 or 2028. That is worth knowing in context, because three other heart-failure medicines were selected in the first negotiation cycle and have had negotiated prices in effect since January 1, 2026 — Entresto, Farxiga and Jardiance. If you are on Inpefa and cost is the obstacle, the comparison with those three is a legitimate conversation to have with your cardiologist. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan can spread what you owe across the year.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Not straightforwardly. Lexicon\'s copay program excludes Medicare by name, and the company says only that uninsured patients "may" get help without publishing any criteria for it. Both charitable funds that list Inpefa were closed. For a Medicare beneficiary the practical routes here are Extra Help, the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan, and a conversation about the negotiated-price alternatives in the same class.',

HealthWell\'s Chronic Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathy funds, both Medicare Access funds, were closed too, and Good Days runs no cardiovascular fund. One practical warning: do not apply to the Type 2 diabetes fund. Inpefa is an SGLT2 inhibitor and it is natural to look there, but TotalAssist\'s diabetes approved-medication list does not include it — the funds follow the label indication, and Inpefa\'s is cardiovascular.

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Inpefa?',
      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Inpefa, usually on a brand tier and often behind prior authorization. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65, which carries more weight here than for heart-failure drugs that have negotiated prices.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there an Inpefa patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Not one with published terms. Lexicon says on its financial-support page that "If you don\'t have insurance or your insurance doesn\'t cover INPEFA, you may still get help paying for INPEFA" — but it publishes no program name, no income limits, no criteria and no application route. Rather than fill that gap from a third-party site, this page records it. Call INPEFA Together on 1-855-246-7332 and ask specifically about patient assistance, and ask whether a Part D plan that denies Inpefa counts as insurance that "doesn\'t cover" it.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the $10 Inpefa copay card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Lexicon\'s terms are broad: "Offer not valid for prescriptions reimbursed under Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medigap, Medicaid, VA, DoD, or TRICARE." Medigap appears in that list, which some manufacturers leave out, so having a supplement policy is itself disqualifying. The program also caps at 13 uses a year even for those who can use it.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why is Inpefa not on the diabetes charity fund when it is an SGLT2 inhibitor?',
      answer:
        'Because the funds follow the label indication rather than the drug class. Inpefa\'s label indicates it "to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and urgent heart failure visit" — it has no blood-sugar-lowering indication, even though it works the same way as Farxiga and Jardiance, which do. So TotalAssist lists Inpefa on its Heart failure and Stroke funds and not on its Type 2 diabetes fund. If you apply to the diabetes fund you will be applying against a list your medication is not on.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Inpefa part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Inpefa or sotagliflozin row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028. Three other medicines used in heart failure were selected in the first cycle and have had negotiated prices in effect since January 1, 2026 — Entresto, Farxiga and Jardiance. Inpefa is a newer, single-product medicine from a small manufacturer, which is the usual reason a drug has not yet reached the selection criteria.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Inpefa?',
      answer:
        'No. DailyMed lists a single labelled sotagliflozin product, Lexicon\'s Inpefa. There is no generic to ask your prescriber about, which is why the practical alternatives on this page are a formulary exception, the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan, Extra Help, and the conversation about negotiated-price medicines in the same class.
