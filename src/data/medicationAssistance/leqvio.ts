// Leqvio (inclisiran) — Novartis. Independently researched 2026-08-26. Every
// program below was read on the official source cited with it. Batch 5 (spec
// §24 Phase 4 list) — a NEW slug.
//
// Leqvio is different from every other medication in the registry in one way
// that changes the whole page: it is injected by a healthcare professional
// twice a year, so Medicare pays for it under PART B (the medical benefit),
// not Part D. That means Extra Help does not apply, the 20% Part B coinsurance
// is what Medigap or a Medicare Savings Program covers, and the Part D cap is
// irrelevant. Novartis's own patient FAQ says so in plain words and is quoted.
//
// Research gaps carried honestly: the LEQVIO Co-pay Program's terms page
// (start.leqvio.com) refused every connection, so only the exclusion and
// "as little as $0" language on leqvio.com is recorded; NPAF's income table
// lives inside a JavaScript wizard and is not reproduced. The research agent
// for this medication was cut off by a session limit; the sources below were
// read directly instead, on the same day.

  description:
    'Leqvio is a twice-yearly cholesterol injection given in a doctor\'s office — an siRNA that switches off the liver\'s production of PCSK9 so the liver clears more LDL cholesterol. Because a healthcare professional administers it, Medicare pays for it under Part B, not Part D, which changes every rule about what help applies.',

  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Novartis states a list price of $3,587.73 per dose for uninsured patients — three doses in the first year, then two a year. Under Medicare Part B you owe 20% coinsurance on the Medicare-approved amount after the Part B deductible unless a Medigap policy, a Medicare Savings Program or Medicaid picks it up, and Medicare Advantage plans set their own cost-sharing. The Part D $2,100 cap and Extra Help do not apply to a Part B drug, and the manufacturer copay program excludes Medicare.',
  medicareContext:
    'Novartis\'s patient FAQ: "LEQVIO is a medication that is administered by a doctor or other health care provider, so it is covered under traditional Medicare, also called Part B." With traditional Medicare and no supplement, "you would be responsible for a 20% coinsurance payment"; with a Medigap or retiree supplement Novartis says you "may pay as little as $0"; on Medicare Advantage "your out-of-pocket costs will vary." Novartis also says no prior authorization is required for Medicare patients (its own data on file). Because it is a Part B drug, the Part D out-of-pocket cap and Extra Help are not involved — the relevant help is a Medigap policy, a Medicare Savings Program or Medicaid, and charitable funds that pay Part B cost-sharing. Inclisiran has not been selected for Medicare price negotiation for 2026, 2027 or 2028, the first year Part B drugs were eligible.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes — but start with your Medicare coverage itself, because Leqvio is a Part B drug. If you have traditional Medicare with a Medigap policy, or a Medicare Savings Program or Medicaid, your 20% coinsurance is largely or fully covered already. If you are exposed to the coinsurance, TotalAssist\'s Hypercholesterolemia fund was open on August 26, 2026 and lists Leqvio, and the Novartis Patient Assistance Foundation lists Leqvio and accepts patients with government insurance who meet its income guidelines. The LEQVIO Co-pay Program excludes Medicare, HealthWell\'s cholesterol fund was closed, and Good Days has no cholesterol fund.',

      question: 'Is Leqvio covered by Medicare Part B or Part D?',
      answer:
        'Part B. Novartis: "LEQVIO is a medication that is administered by a doctor or other health care provider, so it is covered under traditional Medicare, also called Part B." That means your doctor\'s office bills Medicare, you owe 20% coinsurance after the Part B deductible unless a <a href="/medigap.html">Medigap policy</a>, a Medicare Savings Program or Medicaid covers it, and Medicare Advantage plans apply their own Part B drug cost-sharing. The Part D $2,100 cap does not apply. See <a href="/medicare-part-a-vs-part-b.html">Part A vs Part B</a> for how the parts differ.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does Extra Help lower the cost of Leqvio?',
      answer:
        'No — Extra Help is a Part D program and Leqvio is a Part B drug. The Part B equivalent is a <a href="/medicare-savings-programs-utah.html">Medicare Savings Program</a>: the QMB level pays your Part B premium and cost-sharing, including the coinsurance on office-administered drugs like Leqvio, if your income and resources are within the limits. Extra Help is still worth applying for because it lowers your Part D drugs.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Leqvio patient assistance program?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Leqvio is on the Novartis Patient Assistance Foundation\'s supported-medications list (checked August 26, 2026). NPAF provides Novartis medicines free to eligible patients who "are uninsured or have government insurance" and meet its income guidelines; it may ask for an Extra Help denial letter and proof of income. NPAF does not publish an income table on its site — check eligibility at pap.novartis.com or call 1-800-277-2254.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the LEQVIO Co-pay Program with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Novartis\'s terms: "Offer not valid under Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, VA, DoD, or any other federal or state program." The program is for people with private (commercial) insurance, who may pay as little as $0.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Leqvio right now?',
      answer:
        'Yes — when we checked on August 26, 2026, TotalAssist\'s Hypercholesterolemia fund was open: $1,900 guaranteed, up to $3,800, for people with Medicare, Medicaid or TRICARE and income at or below 500% of the federal poverty level, and Leqvio is on its list. Confirm with TotalAssist that Part B coinsurance on an office-administered drug qualifies. HealthWell\'s cholesterol fund lists Leqvio but was closed, and Good Days has no cholesterol program.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does Leqvio cost without insurance?',
      answer:
        'Novartis states "The LEQVIO list price for uninsured patients is $3,587.73 per dose." Dosing is one injection, another at three months, then every six months — three doses in the first year and two a year after that. Leqvio is not sold at a cash price on TrumpRx.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Leqvio a Medicare negotiated-price drug?',
      answer:
        'No. Inclisiran was not selected for the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program for 2026, 2027 or 2028 — 2028 was the first year Part B drugs could be selected, and no PCSK9-directed medicine was chosen.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if the fund is closed?',
      answer:
        'TotalAssist offers text, email or phone notifications with no waitlist or queue, and HealthWell says closed funds reopen as funding is replenished. While you wait: check whether you qualify for a Medicare Savings Program, ask your doctor\'s office to have the LEQVIO Service Center verify your benefits, and ask about NPAF.
