// Zepbound (tirzepatide) — Eli Lilly and Company. Independently researched
// 2026-08-26. Every program below was read on the official source cited with
// it. Batch 5 (spec §24 Phase 4 list) — a NEW slug.
//
// LINK-DARK (D8): /does-medicare-cover-zepbound.html is a CONTROL page in the
// EXP-003 observation cohort. Nothing in this record may link to it, and
// nothing in data/drugCoverage.ts was touched to link back. Coverage context
// points at the /medicare-drug-coverage.html hub instead, exactly as the
// Trelegy record (the other control) does.
//
// What is different about this medication: for weight management it is
// excluded from Part D by statute, but the Zepbound KwikPen is one of three
// drugs in the Medicare GLP-1 Bridge — a live, $50-a-month CMS demonstration
// that Part D enrollees can use from July 1, 2026 to December 31, 2027. That
// route, not a charity or a manufacturer foundation, is the page's centre of
// gravity. GLP-1 record: HIGHER MAINTENANCE RISK (spec §5C).

  description:
    'Zepbound is the weight-management brand of tirzepatide — the same molecule Lilly sells for type 2 diabetes as Mounjaro. Because Medicare Part D excludes drugs used for weight loss, the usual coverage route is closed; what replaces it in 2026–2027 is the Medicare GLP-1 Bridge, which covers the Zepbound KwikPen for $50 a month.',
  usedFor: [
    'Reducing excess body weight and maintaining weight reduction long term in adults with obesity, or adults with overweight and at least one weight-related condition, together with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity',
    'Treating moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults with obesity',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Lilly publishes no dollar list price for Zepbound; the federal TrumpRx site shows an original price of $1,087 a month against its $299 discount listing. Because Part D excludes agents used for weight loss, a Part D plan will not pay for Zepbound prescribed for weight management at all — so without the Bridge or a cash price you face the full amount, and nothing you spend on it counts toward the $2,100 Part D cap. Lilly Cares does not cover Zepbound and the savings card excludes Medicare.',
  medicareContext:
    'Two Medicare rules pull in opposite directions. Part D excludes "agents when used for anorexia, weight loss, or weight gain," so Zepbound for weight management is not a Part D benefit; for obstructive sleep apnea with obesity, CMS says the indication "is eligible for Part D coverage," which means a plan may cover it, usually with prior authorization. Separately, the Medicare GLP-1 Bridge — a CMS demonstration running July 1, 2026 to December 31, 2027 — covers the Zepbound KwikPen (not the single-dose pen or vials) for $50 a month for Part D enrollees who meet its BMI-based criteria and do not have type 2 diabetes, OSA or MASH. Tirzepatide has not been selected for Medicare price negotiation for 2026, 2027 or 2028, and CMS says its BALANCE Model is not launching in Medicare in 2027.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'For a Medicare beneficiary prescribed Zepbound for weight management, the one open door in 2026 is the Medicare GLP-1 Bridge: $50 a month for the Zepbound KwikPen, if you meet its criteria. The manufacturer routes are closed to Medicare (Lilly Cares does not list Zepbound; the savings card excludes Medicare), the charity funds that list Zepbound were closed, and Lilly\'s $299–$449 self-pay price is the fallback. If Zepbound is prescribed for sleep apnea, the Bridge does not apply and your Part D plan is the route to ask about.',

  charitableSummary:
    'One charity lists Zepbound for its labelled use — TotalAssist\'s Obesity fund — and it was closed to new applicants on August 26, 2026 (when open: $1,000 guaranteed, $2,000 maximum, any insurance, income at or below 300% FPL). HealthWell has no obesity or sleep-apnea fund and Good Days has none either. The only open TotalAssist fund naming Zepbound is the MASH liver-disease fund, which does not fit a weight-management prescription. For most Medicare beneficiaries the Bridge, not a charity, is the realistic route.',
  extraHelpNote:
    'Extra Help does not touch the Bridge: CMS says the $50 copay "can\'t be lowered by programs like Extra Help." It still matters — it lowers every covered drug in your Part D plan, and if Zepbound is covered by your plan for sleep apnea, Extra Help would apply to that copay in the normal way.',

      answer:
        'For weight management, Part D does not — federal law excludes "agents when used for anorexia, weight loss, or weight gain" from Part D. What exists instead, from July 1, 2026 to December 31, 2027, is the Medicare GLP-1 Bridge: a CMS program that supplies the Zepbound KwikPen for $50 a month to Part D enrollees who meet its criteria. For obstructive sleep apnea with obesity, CMS says the indication is eligible for Part D coverage, so your plan may cover it with prior authorization. See our <a href="/medicare-drug-coverage.html">drug coverage guides</a> for how Part D formularies work.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I get Zepbound for $50 a month on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Through the Medicare GLP-1 Bridge. You need an eligible Part D plan, a prescription written specifically for the Zepbound KwikPen, and to have met the BMI criteria when you started GLP-1 therapy: BMI 35 or higher; BMI 30 or higher with diastolic heart failure, uncontrolled high blood pressure or chronic kidney disease stage 3a+; or BMI 27 or higher with prediabetes, a prior heart attack or stroke, or symptomatic peripheral artery disease. People with type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea or fatty liver disease are not eligible. There is no form for you to fill in — the pharmacy checks eligibility and starts the prior authorization, your doctor completes it, and Medicare mails you a letter. Call 1-800-MEDICARE with questions.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does Extra Help lower the $50 Bridge copay?',
      answer:
        'No. Medicare.gov says the Bridge copayment "Can\'t be lowered by programs like Extra Help," and CMS says there is no low-income subsidy on it. It also does not count toward your Part D deductible or the $2,100 out-of-pocket cap, and it cannot be spread out with the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan. <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Extra Help</a> is still worth having for every other covered drug.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Zepbound patient assistance program?',
      answer:
        'Not from the manufacturer. Zepbound is not on the Lilly Cares Foundation\'s available-medications list (checked August 26, 2026), and neither is Mounjaro. The only charity fund that lists Zepbound for obesity — TotalAssist\'s Obesity fund — was closed to new applicants.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Zepbound savings card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Lilly\'s terms require that you are not enrolled in any government-funded healthcare program, naming Medicare, Medicare Part D, Medicare Advantage and Medigap. The separate KwikPen Self-Pay Savings Card is different: it is a cash card with no government-insurance exclusion, but you must agree not to seek reimbursement and not to count the cost toward any deductible or true out-of-pocket amount.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What does Zepbound cost self-pay, and can I buy it that way on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Lilly\'s self-pay prices on August 26, 2026 were $299 a month for 2.5 mg, $399 for 5 mg and $449 for 7.5 mg through 15 mg when refilled within 45 days (otherwise $499 and $699). Vials are sold only through LillyDirect; the KwikPen is available through LillyDirect or at retail pharmacies with the Self-Pay Savings Card. The self-pay terms do not exclude Medicare enrollees and Lilly shows the option under its Medicare selection, but no sentence says so outright — confirm with LillyDirect Customer Care at 1-844-559-3471. A cash purchase never counts toward your Part D cap.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Zepbound right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist\'s Obesity fund lists Zepbound (when open: $1,000 guaranteed, $2,000 maximum, income at or below 300% FPL, any insurance) but was closed. HealthWell has no obesity or sleep-apnea fund and Good Days has none. TotalAssist\'s open MASH fund names Zepbound, but that fund is for a liver-disease diagnosis. Sign up for notifications at totalassist.org/notify.',

    {
      question: 'What happens if the fund is closed?',
      answer:
        'TotalAssist offers text, email or phone notifications with no waitlist or queue. While you wait: check whether you qualify for the Bridge, ask your prescriber about coverage under an OSA diagnosis if that applies, compare the self-pay price, and compare Part D plans in the fall.
