// Skyrizi (risankizumab-rzaa) — AbbVie. Independently researched 2026-08-26.
// Every program below was read on the official source cited with it. Batch 3
// (spec §24 #14) — a NEW page.
//
// Skyrizi shares myAbbVie Assist with Rinvoq — and, until July 1, 2026, with
// Humira. The Humira record documents that closure. Here the finding is the
// opposite one, and it was checked separately rather than inherited: AbbVie's
// available-programs page lists SKYRIZI among the medicines still in the
// program, and the Skyrizi patient application was revised in June 2026.
//
// RESEARCH NOTE (access): www.abbvie.com serves a Cloudflare block page; the
// apex host abbvie.com serves the same pages, and AbbVie's application PDFs
// are readable under abbvie.com/content/dam/.
//
// The Medicare rule here is a trap worth stating plainly: myAbbVie Assist
// accepts Medicare, but a Part D enrollee who takes free medicine gets no
// true-out-of-pocket credit for it, and AbbVie notifies the drug plan.

  // "SKYRIZI is an interleukin-23 antagonist" (label) — a biologic.
  drugClass: ['biologic'],
  description:
    'Skyrizi is an injected interleukin-23 antagonist used for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, active psoriatic arthritis, and moderately to severely active Crohn\'s disease and ulcerative colitis. Maintenance doses are given every eight or twelve weeks depending on the condition, which changes how the cost lands across a Medicare year.',
  usedFor: [
    'Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults and children 6 and older who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy',
    'Active psoriatic arthritis in adults and children 6 and older',
    'Moderately to severely active Crohn\'s disease in adults',
    'Moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Skyrizi is a brand-only biologic with no generic or biosimilar, and Part D plans place it on a specialty tier where you pay a percentage of a high price rather than a flat copay. Because doses are spaced weeks apart, a single fill can be large enough to carry you a long way toward the annual out-of-pocket cap in one go — which is exactly when the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan is worth knowing about.',
  medicareContext:
    'Skyrizi is generally covered under Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans, usually on a specialty tier and often with prior authorization or step therapy. When it is given as an infusion for Crohn\'s disease induction, that part may fall under Part B instead — ask your prescriber which benefit each stage of your treatment runs through, because the assistance rules differ. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026 and can be spread across the year with the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan. Skyrizi is not on the Medicare-negotiated drug lists for 2026 or 2027.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes, and the manufacturer route is open. AbbVie\'s myAbbVie Assist program lists Skyrizi among its available medicines and accepts people with Medicare — with one condition that catches Part D enrollees, and one consequence worth understanding before you enrol. The savings card excludes Medicare, and every autoimmune and bowel-disease charity fund we checked was closed to new applicants.',
    points: [
      'myAbbVie Assist: Skyrizi is on AbbVie\'s current available-medicines list, and the Skyrizi patient application was revised in June 2026. AbbVie describes the program as being for people who are "uninsured, receiving coverage through Medicare, or your health insurance isn\'t enough to cover the cost."',
      'The Medicare condition: if you have Medicare and household income below 150% of the federal poverty level, AbbVie will not enrol you unless you have applied for Extra Help and been denied — and you must send the denial letter with your application. Above 150% FPL, no denial letter is needed.',
      'The consequence to weigh: AbbVie\'s terms say a Part D enrollee must not buy Skyrizi through their Medicare plan while enrolled, gets no true-out-of-pocket (TrOOP) credit for the free medicine, and that myAbbVie Assist will tell your drug plan you are receiving it outside the Part D benefit. Free medicine does not move you toward the $2,100 cap.',
      'SKYRIZI Complete Savings Card: commercially insured patients only. AbbVie\'s terms exclude Medicare including Part D, Medicare Advantage, Medigap, Medicaid, TRICARE, DoD and VA.',
      'AbbVie\'s Bridge Program is not a Medicare route either — it is limited to commercially insured patients aged 63 or younger who have a coverage denial on file.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Skyrizi?',
      answer:
        'Generally yes. Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans cover Skyrizi, usually on a specialty tier and often with prior authorization or step therapy. If your treatment includes an infusion — the induction stage for Crohn\'s disease — that portion may be billed under Part B instead, so ask your prescriber which benefit each stage runs through. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can lower a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Skyrizi patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Yes. AbbVie\'s myAbbVie Assist program lists Skyrizi among its available medicines, and AbbVie describes the program as being for people who are "uninsured, receiving coverage through Medicare, or your health insurance isn\'t enough to cover the cost of my medicine." One rule applies specifically to Medicare: if your household income is below 150% of the federal poverty level, you are not eligible unless you have applied for Extra Help and been denied, and you must include the denial letter. Apply through AbbVie Patient Access Support or call 1-800-222-6885, Monday–Friday 7am–7pm Central.',
    },
    {
      question: 'If AbbVie gives me Skyrizi free, does that count toward my Part D out-of-pocket cap?',
      answer:
        'No, and this is worth understanding before you enrol. AbbVie\'s terms of participation require that you not purchase Skyrizi under your Medicare plan while enrolled, that you not submit claims or seek true out-of-pocket (TrOOP) credit for the medicine provided, and they state that myAbbVie Assist will inform your Medicare drug plan that you are receiving the medication at no cost outside the Part D benefit. Free medicine is genuinely free — it simply does not move you toward the $2,100 cap for your other drugs.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the SKYRIZI Complete Savings Card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. AbbVie\'s terms state the copay assistance program is not available to patients receiving prescription reimbursement under any federal, state or government-funded insurance program, and name Medicare including Part D, Medicare Advantage, Medigap, Medicaid, TRICARE, DoD and VA. Skyrizi.com points Medicare patients toward Extra Help instead. Federal anti-kickback rules are the reason — see the key terms lower on this page.',
    },
    {
      question: 'AbbVie stopped covering Humira. Does that affect Skyrizi?',
      answer:
        'No. AbbVie removed HUMIRA from myAbbVie Assist for new patients effective July 1, 2026, but the program itself continues and Skyrizi is still on AbbVie\'s available-medicines list — its patient application was revised in June 2026. AbbVie even names Skyrizi as one of the treatments that may be available through myAbbVie Assist for patients affected by the Humira change. Because AbbVie has shown it will remove a medicine from the list, check that Skyrizi is still on it before you apply.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Skyrizi right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Skyrizi under its psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease funds, and HealthWell lists it on the AutoImmune and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Medicare Access funds. All six were closed to new applicants. Good Days has no matching fund. Sign up for alerts at both foundations and check back; funds reopen when money arrives.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic or biosimilar for Skyrizi?',
      answer:
        'No. Risankizumab-rzaa is a brand-only biologic with no generic and no biosimilar marketed in the United States. If cost is the problem, the routes on this page — myAbbVie Assist, Extra Help, a formulary exception, and a plan comparison in the fall — are where the movement is.
