// Yupelri (revefenacin) — Viatris. Independently researched 2026-08-26.
// Batch 8 — a NEW slug.
//
// Yupelri is the only medication in this registry that a Medicare beneficiary
// normally receives under PART B rather than Part D, and that single fact
// reorders the entire assistance page.
//
// Yupelri is an inhalation SOLUTION given through a jet nebulizer with an air
// compressor — not a handheld inhaler. Medicare covers nebulizers as durable
// medical equipment, and the drugs used in them under the Part B DME benefit.
// Viatris's own coverage page states it plainly: "Medicare Part B also covers
// most nebulizers as durable medical equipment (DME) for patient use at home",
// Part B covers 80% with the patient responsible for the remaining 20%, and with
// Medigap supplemental coverage a patient "may pay as little as $0 out of pocket
// for YUPELRI."
//
// The consequences are not cosmetic:
//   • EXTRA HELP DOES NOTHING HERE. Extra Help is a Part D low-income subsidy. It
//     does not reduce a Part B coinsurance. Every other record in this batch
//     points readers at Extra Help as a primary route; this one must not, and the
//     page says why.
//   • MEDIGAP AND MEDICARE SAVINGS PROGRAMS ARE THE TOOLS INSTEAD. A Medigap
//     policy that covers Part B coinsurance is what takes the 20% to zero.
//   • The Part D out-of-pocket cap does not apply to it either.
//
// This is the clearest possible case of criterion 6 — Medicare-specific
// usefulness — and it is information a reader cannot get from a generic
// "prescription assistance" page.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Yupelri is a once-daily COPD maintenance treatment that comes as a liquid you breathe in through a nebulizer, not as a handheld inhaler. That difference is medical for some people — a nebulizer can be easier if you cannot coordinate a handheld device — and it is financial for everyone on Medicare, because a nebulized drug is usually paid for under Part B rather than Part D. Almost every piece of prescription-assistance advice you have read assumes Part D. For this medication, most of it does not apply.',
  usedFor: [
    'Maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), given once daily through a standard jet nebulizer with a mouthpiece connected to an air compressor',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Yupelri is a brand-only medication — DailyMed labels a single revefenacin product, with no generic — and it is used every day indefinitely. But the reason costs surprise people is structural rather than about the price: because it is nebulized, Medicare usually pays for it under Part B, where you owe a straight 20% coinsurance with no annual out-of-pocket cap, rather than under Part D, where the $2,100 cap and Extra Help both apply. A 20% share that never stops accumulating behaves very differently from a copay inside a capped drug benefit.',
  medicareContext:
    'This is the most important section on the page. Yupelri is an inhalation solution given through a nebulizer, and Medicare covers nebulizers as durable medical equipment (DME) under Part B along with the medications used in them. Viatris states it directly: "Medicare Part B also covers most nebulizers as durable medical equipment (DME) for patient use at home", Part B pays 80% of nebulized COPD treatments like Yupelri, and you are responsible for the remaining 20%. Medicare Advantage plans likewise cover 80%. Three consequences follow, and they run against the standard advice on this site. First, Medicare Extra Help does not help — it is a Part D low-income subsidy and it does not touch a Part B coinsurance. Second, the $2,100 Part D out-of-pocket cap does not apply either, so there is no ceiling on the 20%. Third, the tool that does work is supplemental coverage: Viatris notes that with a Medigap policy a patient "may pay as little as $0 out of pocket for YUPELRI", because most Medigap plans cover the Part B coinsurance. A Medicare Savings Program can help too. Confirm with your supplier and prescriber which benefit your Yupelri is billed under before acting on any of this, because a small number of situations are billed differently.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'The usual answer is the wrong one here. Yupelri is normally a Medicare Part B drug, not a Part D drug, because it is nebulized — so Extra Help does nothing for it and the Part D out-of-pocket cap does not apply. What does work is Medigap, which can take the 20% Part B coinsurance to zero. The manufacturer savings card excludes Medicare, and both COPD charitable funds were closed.',
    points: [
      'Part B, not Part D: Viatris states that "Medicare Part B also covers most nebulizers as durable medical equipment (DME) for patient use at home", that Part B covers 80% of nebulized COPD treatments like Yupelri, and that you pay the remaining 20%.',
      'Medigap is the lever: with supplemental coverage Viatris says a patient "may pay as little as $0 out of pocket for YUPELRI". Most Medigap plans cover the Part B coinsurance.',
      'Extra Help will NOT reduce your Yupelri cost if it is billed under Part B — it is a Part D subsidy. This is the single most common mistake with nebulized drugs.',

  charitableSummary:
    'The charitable funds matter more for Yupelri than for the handheld inhalers on this site, for a reason worth understanding. Because Yupelri is usually billed under Medicare Part B, the Part D safety nets — Extra Help and the $2,100 out-of-pocket cap — do not apply to it. The charitable funds do: both TotalAssist and HealthWell pay toward coinsurance, and a Part B coinsurance is a qualifying expense. So the funds are one of the few forms of help here that are indifferent to which Medicare benefit pays. TotalAssist lists "Yupelri (Revefenacin)" on its COPD fund and COPD health equity fund, each $1,200 guaranteed up to $3,500, and both were closed on August 26, 2026; HealthWell\'s COPD – Medicare Access fund was closed too; Good Days has no COPD fund. Set alerts on both foundations, and in the meantime put your effort into the Medigap question, which is the larger lever.',
  extraHelpNote:
    'Read this before applying for Extra Help on account of Yupelri: if your Yupelri is billed under Medicare Part B, as nebulized COPD drugs usually are, Extra Help will not reduce what you pay for it. Extra Help is the Part D Low-Income Subsidy — it lowers Part D premiums, deductibles and copays, and a Part B coinsurance is none of those things. That does not make Extra Help worthless: it will still lower the cost of every Part D medication you take, and qualifying for a Medicare Savings Program brings Extra Help with it automatically. But for the Yupelri bill specifically, the tools are Medigap and a Medicare Savings Program. This is the most common and most expensive misunderstanding about nebulized drugs on Medicare, which is why it is spelled out here rather than left implied.',

Viatris states that "Medicare Part B also covers most nebulizers as durable medical equipment (DME) for patient use at home", that Part B covers 80% of nebulized COPD treatments like Yupelri, and that you pay the remaining 20%. Medicare Advantage plans cover it at the same 80% level. Confirm how your own supply is billed with your prescriber\'s office or DME supplier.',

      question: 'Will Medicare Extra Help lower my Yupelri cost?',

        'Not if your Yupelri is billed under Part B, and that is the usual case. Extra Help is the Part D Low-Income Subsidy: it lowers Part D premiums, deductibles and copays. A Part B coinsurance is none of those, so Extra Help does not touch it. This is the most common and most expensive misunderstanding about nebulized drugs on Medicare. Extra Help is still worth having for your other medications, and qualifying for a <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/basics/costs/help/medicare-savings-programs">Medicare Savings Program</a> brings it automatically — but for the Yupelri bill, Medigap and a Medicare Savings Program are the tools.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I get my 20% Yupelri coinsurance down to zero?',
      answer:
        'Supplemental coverage is the usual answer. Most standardised Medigap policies cover the Part B coinsurance, which is why Viatris can say that with a Medigap policy a patient "may pay as little as $0 out of pocket for YUPELRI". If a Medigap premium is out of reach, a Medicare Savings Program can cover the Part B deductible and coinsurance at some levels. And unlike Extra Help, the TotalAssist and HealthWell COPD grants do pay toward coinsurance, so they work for a Part B bill when they reopen.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Yupelri patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Viatris runs a patient assistance program and publishes a contact route for it on the Yupelri site — ViatrisPAP@viatris.com, fax 877-427-7290 — but it does not publish the income limits, the insurance rules or any Medicare rule for it on those pages, and the Viatris patient-support page we tried returned a 404 error on August 26, 2026. So the honest answer is that a program exists and its criteria could not be established. Email or fax and ask whether Medicare beneficiaries qualify and whether Part B and Part D patients are treated differently — that last question matters more for Yupelri than for most medicines.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Yupelri savings card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Viatris\'s terms say "This offer is not valid for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or any other federal or state-funded healthcare program or where prohibited by law." Being covered by Medicare is the disqualifier, so it makes no difference whether your Yupelri runs through Part B or Part D. One further restriction worth noting even for commercially insured readers: absent a change in Massachusetts law, the savings program is no longer valid for Massachusetts residents as of January 1, 2026.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Yupelri?',
      answer:
        'No. DailyMed lists a single labelled revefenacin product, Viatris\'s Yupelri. There is no generic version. If cost is the obstacle, the conversation worth having with your prescriber is not about a generic but about whether a handheld inhaler would suit you — those are Part D drugs, where Extra Help and the $2,100 out-of-pocket cap apply.
