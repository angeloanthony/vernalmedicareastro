// Savaysa (edoxaban) — Daiichi Sankyo. Independently researched 2026-08-26.
// Batch 8 — a NEW slug.
//
// Savaysa is the hardest case in this entire expansion, and that is exactly why
// it needs a page. It is the one medication where the answer to "what help is
// there?" is genuinely, verifiably, almost nothing:
//
//   • NO manufacturer cost support of any kind. savaysa.com has no savings, copay
//     or assistance section — its only sections are Home, SAVAYSA for AFib,
//     SAVAYSA for DVT/PE, FAQs, Prescribing Information and Medication Guide.
//     daiichisankyo.us/patient-assistance returns 404. Daiichi Sankyo's actual
//     assistance program, AccessCentral4U, covers only DATROWAY, ENHERTU, TURALIO
//     and VANFLYTA — all oncology products. Savaysa is in none of them.
//   • NO generic. DailyMed labels exactly one edoxaban product.
//   • NO negotiated price. Savaysa is on no CMS selected-drug list.
//   • ONE charitable fund, and it was closed.
//
// Every other anticoagulant on this site has at least one working route: Eliquis
// and Xarelto have Medicare-negotiated prices, Pradaxa has nineteen generic
// labelers. Savaysa has none of them. Publishing that plainly is more useful than
// a page full of programs a reader would waste an afternoon discovering do not
// apply — and it makes the alternatives conversation with a cardiologist the real
// content of the page.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Savaysa is a once-daily anticoagulant — a blood thinner that slows the clotting proteins in blood — used for atrial fibrillation and for clots in the legs and lungs. It is the least-supported medication on this site: Daiichi Sankyo publishes no savings card, no copay program and no patient assistance program for it, there is no generic, and the one charitable fund that lists it was closed. This page tells you that plainly, because knowing it saves you an afternoon of looking.',
  usedFor: [
    'Reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, subject to the kidney-function limits in the label',
    'Treating deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after 5 to 10 days of an injectable blood thinner',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Savaysa is a brand-only tablet with no generic — DailyMed labels exactly one edoxaban product — taken indefinitely once started, and Part D plans place it on a brand tier. What makes its cost picture unusually hard is not the price but the absence of everything that normally softens it: no manufacturer copay card, no manufacturer patient assistance program, no negotiated Medicare price and no generic. Among the direct oral anticoagulants, Savaysa is the only one with none of those.',
  medicareContext:
    'Savaysa is a tablet you take yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, usually on a brand tier. It is not a Medicare-negotiated drug: CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Savaysa or edoxaban row for 2026, 2027 or 2028. The comparison matters here more than on most pages. Eliquis and Xarelto were both selected in the first negotiation cycle and have had negotiated prices in effect since January 1, 2026; Pradaxa is available as a generic from nineteen labelers. Savaysa has neither route. So for a Medicare beneficiary the tools that remain are the general ones — the $2,100 Part D out-of-pocket cap in 2026, Extra Help, the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan, and a plan comparison in the fall — plus a genuine clinical conversation about whether one of the other anticoagulants would serve you as well. One important note on that conversation: Savaysa\'s label carries kidney-function limits that the others do not share in the same form, so this is a decision for your prescriber and not a swap to make on cost grounds alone.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'No — and this is the clearest negative finding in this whole section. Daiichi Sankyo publishes no savings card, no copay program and no patient assistance program covering Savaysa; its assistance program covers four oncology medicines only. There is no generic edoxaban and no Medicare-negotiated price. The single charitable fund that lists Savaysa was closed.',

    'One fund lists Savaysa and it was closed. TotalAssist\'s Stroke fund names both "Savaysa (Edoxaban)" and "Lixiana (Edoxaban)" on its approved-medication list, paying $1,000 guaranteed up to $1,500 when open, and it was shut on August 26, 2026. HealthWell runs no atrial fibrillation, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or anticoagulant fund at all, and Good Days has none either. That single closed fund is the entire charitable picture for this medication, and unlike most pages on this site there is no manufacturer program sitting behind it. Set the TotalAssist alert today. Then put your real effort into Extra Help, the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan, and a conversation with your cardiologist about the alternatives — because for Savaysa those are not fallbacks, they are the plan.',
  extraHelpNote:
    'Extra Help matters more for Savaysa than for almost any other medication on this site, because it is the only income-based help that exists for it. There is no manufacturer program to weigh it against, no generic to switch to and no negotiated price to wait for — so there is no conflict, no sequencing question and nothing to lose. If your income and resources are limited, apply, and apply even if you assume you earn too much: the limits are higher than most people expect. With full Extra Help a covered brand-name drug costs about $12.65 in 2026, which against brand-tier cost-sharing on a daily anticoagulant is the single largest difference available to you.',

      question: 'Should I switch to a different blood thinner to save money?',
      answer:
        'That is a fair question to raise with your cardiologist, but it is a clinical decision and not one to make on price alone. Eliquis and Xarelto have had Medicare-negotiated prices in effect since January 1, 2026, and generic dabigatran costs a fraction of any brand. However, Savaysa\'s label carries kidney-function limits that shape who it is prescribed for, so if you were specifically put on Savaysa there may be a reason. Bring your most recent kidney function results to the appointment and ask directly. Never stop or ration an anticoagulant while you wait for that conversation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Savaysa part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Savaysa or edoxaban row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028. Two other direct oral anticoagulants were selected in the very first cycle and have had negotiated prices in effect since January 1, 2026 — Eliquis and Xarelto. Your Savaysa cost is set entirely by your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, which is why a careful plan comparison in the fall matters more for this medication than for most.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Savaysa right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists "Savaysa (Edoxaban)" on its Stroke fund and that fund was closed, with a $1,000 guaranteed and $1,500 maximum award. It is the only fund on any of the three foundations that covers this medication — HealthWell runs no anticoagulation fund at all, and neither does Good Days. Set the TotalAssist alert, because with no manufacturer program behind it, that one fund reopening is a more significant event for Savaysa than it would be for most drugs.
