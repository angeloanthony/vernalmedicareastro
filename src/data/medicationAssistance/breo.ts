// Breo Ellipta (fluticasone furoate / vilanterol) — GSK. Independently
// researched 2026-08-26. Batch 8 — a NEW slug.
//
// This record exists because Batch 7's decision to drop Breo Ellipta was made on
// an incomplete picture, and the research that settles it is decisive rather
// than marginal. Batch 7 dropped Breo on criterion 5 (material differentiation),
// reasoning that it was "the same GSK program with no published medicine list,
// the same closed COPD and asthma funds" as Trelegy. Two of those three premises
// turned out to be wrong:
//
//  1. GSK DOES publish a covered-medicine list. gskpaf.org carries a "List of
//     eligible products" accordion naming 20 medicines, and its screener embeds
//     a per-product CATEGORY that decides which Medicare page a patient is routed
//     to. Breo is a "general" product, which puts it behind a $600-a-year
//     prescription-spending threshold that Nucala — a "specialty" product from the
//     same foundation — does not have. That is a per-medication rule the project
//     previously recorded as unavailable.
//  2. Breo Ellipta is a MEDICARE-NEGOTIATED DRUG. CMS selected it for initial
//     price applicability year 2027 and set a maximum fair price of $67.00 per
//     30-day equivalent supply, effective January 1, 2027. Trelegy is also on the
//     IPAY 2027 list, but the two carry different negotiated prices, and a
//     negotiated price is exactly the kind of Medicare-specific fact criterion 6
//     is for.
//
// Third finding, smaller but useful: an authorized generic exists. DailyMed
// labels "FLUTICASONE FUROATE AND VILANTEROL POWDER" from Prasco Laboratories
// alongside GSK's brand — which is not true of Trelegy.
//
// Honest negatives carried here: Breo is NOT on GSK's copay-assistance list (that
// list is Benlysta, Blenrep, Exdensur, Jemperli, Nucala, Ojjaara, Zejula), and it
// is NOT offered through GSK Direct to You, which does supply Anoro and Incruse
// at published cash prices. Both are recorded as findings rather than omissions.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: this record contains no does-medicare-cover-* link.

  description:
    'Breo Ellipta is a once-daily maintenance inhaler that combines an inhaled steroid with a long-acting bronchodilator. It is one of the few inhalers licensed for both COPD and asthma, and from January 1, 2027 it is also one of the small number of medications for which Medicare has negotiated a price directly with the manufacturer.',
  usedFor: [
    'Maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), to improve airflow and reduce flare-ups',
    'Maintenance treatment of asthma in patients aged 5 years and older',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Breo Ellipta is a once-daily brand inhaler that most Part D plans place on a brand tier, often behind step therapy that asks you to try a cheaper inhaler first. Two things pull the other way, and both are specific to this medication. Medicare negotiated its price: CMS set a maximum fair price of $67.00 for a 30-day equivalent supply, effective January 1, 2027. And an authorized generic now exists — DailyMed labels fluticasone furoate and vilanterol inhalation powder from Prasco Laboratories alongside GSK\'s brand, which is not true of every inhaler on this site.',
  medicareContext:
    'Breo Ellipta is an inhaler you use yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan. It is one of the 15 drugs CMS selected for the second cycle of Medicare drug price negotiation: the maximum fair price is $67.00 per 30-day equivalent supply and it takes effect on January 1, 2027 for people whose Part D plans cover it. A negotiated price is not a cash price — it changes what plans and enrollees pay, not what a pharmacy charges someone paying out of pocket. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan can spread what you owe across the year.',

      'Yes — GSK runs a patient assistance program that covers Breo Ellipta and has a genuine Medicare pathway, but that pathway has a condition most people do not expect: you must already have paid $600 for prescriptions this calendar year.

    points: [

TotalAssist lists it on its COPD fund, its Asthma fund and the health-equity version of both — four funds, all closed on August 26, 2026, each paying a $1,200 guaranteed award up to $3,500. HealthWell runs an Asthma fund and a COPD – Medicare Access fund and both were closed as well. Good Days has no respiratory fund at all. Set alerts on TotalAssist and HealthWell, because with six closed funds between them the odds that one reopens are better than average — but do not build your year around it. The routes that do not depend on a fund balance are GSK\'s patient assistance program, the authorized generic, Extra Help, and Medicare\'s negotiated price from January 2027.',
  extraHelpNote:
    'Extra Help interacts with the GSK program in a way worth understanding before you apply to either. GSK\'s Medicare route for Breo does not exclude Extra Help enrollees — the $600 prescription-spending threshold is what governs — so unlike some manufacturer programs there is no penalty for holding both. Apply for Extra Help on its own merits: it lowers the cost of every covered drug you take, not just this one, and with full Extra Help a covered brand-name drug costs about $12.65 in 2026.',

        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Breo Ellipta, usually on a brand tier and sometimes behind step therapy. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. From January 1, 2027 a Medicare-negotiated maximum fair price of $67.00 per 30-day equivalent supply applies to Part D plans. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Breo Ellipta patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Breo Ellipta is on the GSK Patient Assistance Program\'s published list of eligible products, and the program has a Medicare route. The condition people miss is the spending threshold: for GSK\'s "general" category of medicines, which includes Breo, you must have "paid a total of $600 for prescriptions in the current calendar year". You also need a Medicare drug plan and income at or below $47,880 for one person in the 48 states and DC. Both you and your prescriber sign the form.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why does Nucala have different GSK rules from Breo Ellipta?',
      answer:
        'Because GSK sorts its medicines into categories and applies different Medicare rules to each. Breo Ellipta is a "general" product, which carries the $600 prescription-spending threshold and a $47,880 income limit for one person. Nucala is a "specialty" product: it has no spending threshold and a higher income limit of $63,840, but it excludes anyone enrolled in Medicare Extra Help. Same foundation, same application line, genuinely different rules — so check the rule for your own medicine rather than the one a friend was told.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Breo Ellipta part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Breo Ellipta is one of the 15 drugs CMS selected for the second cycle of negotiation. CMS\'s selected-drug file gives it a single maximum fair price of $67.00 per 30-day equivalent supply, effective January 1, 2027. That price applies to Part D plans and the people enrolled in them — it is not a pharmacy cash price, and it does not change what you pay before 2027. CMS also publishes an explanation of how the price was reached.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Breo Ellipta?',
      answer:
        'There is an authorized generic. DailyMed lists three labelled fluticasone furoate and vilanterol products across two labelers: GSK\'s Breo Ellipta, GSK\'s Trelegy Ellipta (which adds a third ingredient), and "Fluticasone Furoate and Vilanterol Powder" from Prasco Laboratories. Whether it saves you money depends on your plan\'s formulary, so ask your prescriber and your plan directly.',

      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Breo Ellipta right now?',
      answer:

Because Breo is licensed for both COPD and asthma it appears on more fund lists than most inhalers — TotalAssist\'s COPD fund, Asthma fund and the health-equity version of each, all closed at $1,200 guaranteed and $3,500 maximum, and HealthWell\'s Asthma and COPD – Medicare Access funds, also closed. Good Days has no respiratory fund. Six closed funds is worth setting alerts on, but plan around the GSK program and the generic rather than waiting.
