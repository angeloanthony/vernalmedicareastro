// Rybelsus (semaglutide tablets) — Novo Nordisk. Independently researched
// 2026-08-26. Every program below was read on the official source cited with
// it. Batch 5 (spec §24 Phase 4 list) — a NEW slug.
//
// The finding that shapes this page: on May 4, 2026 Novo Nordisk began
// replacing Rybelsus in the United States with "Ozempic" tablets (1.5 / 4 /
// 9 mg) — a reformulated pill under one combined FDA label. Rybelsus is not on
// the 2026 Patient Assistance Program product list, has no self-pay price, and
// its savings-offer pages now redirect to the Ozempic offer. Most of the
// "programs" below are therefore honest negatives, and the page's job is to
// say so plainly and point to the routes that DO exist. GLP-1 record: HIGHER
// MAINTENANCE RISK (spec §5C).

  description:
    'Rybelsus is the once-daily semaglutide tablet for type 2 diabetes — the same molecule as the Ozempic injection. In May 2026 Novo Nordisk began replacing it in the United States with reformulated "Ozempic" tablets, which changes which assistance programs still name it.',
  usedFor: [
    'Improving blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes, along with diet and exercise',
    'Reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack or non-fatal stroke) in adults with type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for these events',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'CMS put the 2024 list price of the semaglutide products (Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy) at $959 for a 30-day supply. Part D plans usually place Rybelsus on a high brand tier with prior authorization, so the copay or coinsurance can be large until you reach the $2,100 annual cap. For 2026, Novo Nordisk\'s patient assistance program does not list Rybelsus at all, and NovoCare Pharmacy sells the successor Ozempic pill self-pay but not Rybelsus.',
  medicareContext:
    'Medicare Part D covers GLP-1 medicines such as Rybelsus when prescribed for type 2 diabetes, not for weight loss. Semaglutide — listed by CMS as "Ozempic; Rybelsus; Wegovy" — was selected in the second cycle of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program: the negotiated price is $274 for a 30-day supply (CMS\'s worked example for Rybelsus 7 mg, 30 tablets, is $276.78) and takes effect January 1, 2027. Separately, Novo Nordisk has said it will cut the list price of Rybelsus 7 mg and 14 mg to $675 on the same date. The Medicare GLP-1 Bridge ($50 a month) does not include Rybelsus and excludes people with type 2 diabetes. Novo says the Ozempic pill "will have the same coverage as RYBELSUS" — check your plan\'s formulary for both names.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Very little assistance names Rybelsus in 2026. Novo Nordisk is replacing Rybelsus with the Ozempic pill in the United States, the patient assistance program does not list Rybelsus, there is no Rybelsus self-pay price, the savings offer is for commercial insurance only, and the type 2 diabetes charity funds at TotalAssist and HealthWell — both of which list Rybelsus — were closed to new applicants when we checked. What remains: Medicare Extra Help, a negotiated Part D price from January 2027, fund alerts, and a conversation with your prescriber about the Ozempic pill, which does have a self-pay price.',

      'Charitable grants: Rybelsus is on the type 2 diabetes fund lists at TotalAssist and HealthWell, but both funds were closed to new applicants on August 26, 2026.',
      'Medicare: not a GLP-1 Bridge drug; a negotiated Part D price of $274 (30-day) starts January 1, 2027; Extra Help can cut a covered brand copay to about $12.65 now if you qualify.',

      question: 'Can Medicare help pay for Rybelsus?',
      answer:
        'Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans cover Rybelsus when it is prescribed for type 2 diabetes (not for weight loss), usually with prior authorization. Your copay depends on your plan\'s tier, and Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can lower a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65. From January 1, 2027 a negotiated Medicare price of $274 for a 30-day supply applies to semaglutide.',
      },
    {
      question: 'Is Rybelsus being discontinued?',
      answer:
        'Novo Nordisk has not published a discontinuation date. What it has said (May 1, 2026) is that the Rybelsus strengths "have been reformulated and are now being introduced as Ozempic (semaglutide) tablets 1.5 mg, 4 mg, and 9 mg," that Rybelsus patients "should continue their medication as directed and speak with their healthcare professionals about transitioning to the Ozempic pill," and that Rybelsus "will continue to be marketed outside the US." NovoCare\'s Rybelsus page now reads "RYBELSUS is being replaced by Ozempic pill." The two are not interchangeable milligram for milligram.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Rybelsus patient assistance program?',
      answer:
        'Not for 2026. Rybelsus is not on the Novo Nordisk Patient Assistance Program\'s product list (checked August 26, 2026); the only GLP-1 on that list is the Ozempic injection, and only for uninsured patients at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. The charity funds that list Rybelsus (TotalAssist and HealthWell type 2 diabetes funds) were both closed to new applicants.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Rybelsus savings offer with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Novo Nordisk\'s terms exclude anyone "enrolled in any federal or state health care program with prescription drug coverage, such as Medicaid, Medicare, VA, DOD, TRICARE" — even if you offer to pay as an uninsured patient. Federal anti-kickback rules are the reason manufacturer copay cards exclude government insurance.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does the $50-a-month Medicare GLP-1 program cover Rybelsus?',
      answer:
        'No. The Medicare GLP-1 Bridge (July 1, 2026 – December 31, 2027) covers Foundayo, Wegovy and the Zepbound KwikPen for weight management, and excludes people with type 2 diabetes — Medicare\'s guidance says their drug plan might cover a GLP-1 for diabetes instead. Rybelsus is not an eligible Bridge drug.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a cash price for Rybelsus?',
      answer:
        'Not from Novo Nordisk. NovoCare Pharmacy sells the Wegovy and Ozempic pens and pills self-pay but not Rybelsus, and Rybelsus is not on TrumpRx. The Ozempic pill is priced at $149 (1.5 mg), $199 (4 mg) and $299 (9 mg) a month self-pay. Novo\'s pharmacy terms describe how a Medicare enrollee may buy self-pay (no reimbursement, nothing counted toward TrOOP), while its launch announcement says government beneficiaries are excluded — call NovoCare before relying on it.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Rybelsus right now?',
      answer:
        'Not for diabetes when we checked on August 26, 2026. Rybelsus is on the type 2 diabetes fund lists at TotalAssist and HealthWell, but both funds were closed, and Good Days has no diabetes program. TotalAssist\'s open MASH fund also lists Rybelsus, but that fund is for a liver-disease diagnosis. Sign up for notifications at totalassist.org/notify and on the HealthWell fund page so you hear when a diabetes fund reopens.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if the fund is closed?',
      answer:
        'TotalAssist offers text, email or phone notifications with no waitlist or queue, and HealthWell says closed funds reopen as funding is replenished. While you wait: apply for Extra Help, ask your prescriber about the Ozempic pill or a covered alternative, and compare Part D plans in the fall.
