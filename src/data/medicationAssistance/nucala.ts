// Nucala (mepolizumab) — GSK. Independently researched 2026-08-26. Batch 8 — a
// NEW slug.
//
// Nucala is the medication that proved GSK does NOT run one Medicare rule across
// its portfolio, and that finding is what this page is built around.
//
// GSK's patient assistance screener assigns every eligible product a CATEGORY,
// and the category decides which Medicare page you are routed to. Nucala is
// "specialty"; the Ellipta inhalers are "general". The two routes differ in ways
// that change who qualifies:
//
//                              Nucala (specialty)        Ellipta inhalers (general)
//   $600 prescription spend    NOT required              REQUIRED
//   Income limit, 1 person     $63,840                   $47,880
//   Extra Help enrollees       EXCLUDED                  not excluded
//   Territories               US, PR and USVI            US and PR
//   Program phone              1-844-225-5894            1-866-728-4368
//
// A Medicare beneficiary on Extra Help can get Anoro through GSK and cannot get
// Nucala. A beneficiary who has spent nothing on prescriptions this year can get
// Nucala and cannot get Anoro. That is a genuine, per-medication rule and it is
// the single most useful thing on this page.
//
// Nucala is also the only respiratory medication in this batch with a GSK COPAY
// program (the Ellipta inhalers have coupons instead) — commercial-only, as all
// copay programs are.
//
// Research gap carried honestly: GSK's screener routes specialty products with
// Medicare to /product-medicare/, which returns HTTP 404. The working page is the
// product-specific slug /nucala-medicare/, which is what is cited here. Recorded
// because a reader following the screener will hit that dead end too.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Nucala is an injected biologic — a monoclonal antibody given every four weeks — used as an add-on treatment when inhalers alone are not controlling severe eosinophilic asthma and certain related conditions. Because it is a biologic rather than an inhaler, it sits on a Part D specialty tier and follows GSK\'s specialty assistance rules, which are materially different from the rules for GSK\'s inhalers.',
  usedFor: [
    'Add-on maintenance treatment of severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype',
    'Add-on maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in patients with an eosinophilic phenotype',
    'Other eosinophil-driven conditions for which GSK holds approval — confirm the exact indication on your own prescription with your prescriber',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Nucala is a brand-only biologic with no generic and no biosimilar — DailyMed labels exactly one mepolizumab product. Part D plans place it on a specialty tier, where you usually pay a percentage of the price rather than a flat copay, and almost always behind prior authorization. Coinsurance on a specialty-tier biologic tends to reach the annual out-of-pocket cap in the first months of the year rather than spreading evenly across it.',
  medicareContext:
    'Nucala is covered under Medicare Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan when you inject it yourself at home, generally on a specialty tier with prior authorization. If it is administered in a clinic, the billing route can differ, so ask your prescriber\'s office which benefit your doses will run through before you plan around a copay figure. Nucala is not a Medicare-negotiated drug: CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Nucala or mepolizumab row for 2026, 2027 or 2028. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan can spread what you owe across the year — which for a specialty-tier biologic is often the difference between an affordable January and an impossible one.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes — and Nucala\'s GSK rules are genuinely different from the rules for GSK\'s inhalers, which is the thing to get right before applying. There is no prescription-spending threshold and the income limit is higher, but anyone enrolled in Medicare Extra Help is excluded. Every applicable charitable fund was closed.',

      'This differs from GSK\'s inhalers on purpose. Anoro, Breo and Incruse require $600 already spent and cap income at $47,880, but do not exclude Extra Help enrollees.',

    'Nucala appears on four TotalAssist funds — Asthma, COPD and the health-equity version of each — and all four were closed on August 26, 2026, each paying $1,200 guaranteed up to $3,500. HealthWell\'s Asthma and COPD – Medicare Access funds were closed as well, and Good Days runs no applicable fund. Two things are worth saying plainly about this picture. First, there is no narrower eosinophilic fund to fall back on: no foundation on this list runs one. Second, the award sizes are calibrated to inhaler costs rather than biologic costs — $3,500 against specialty-tier coinsurance is help, not a solution. So set alerts on TotalAssist and HealthWell, but treat the GSK patient assistance program, Extra Help and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan as the load-bearing routes for this medication.',
  extraHelpNote:
    'Nucala is the one medication in this batch where Extra Help and the manufacturer program are mutually exclusive, so the choice is real. GSK\'s Nucala route excludes anyone enrolled in Extra Help; GSK\'s route for its inhalers does not. If you qualify for Extra Help, it is usually the stronger option for a specialty-tier biologic: it lowers cost-sharing on every covered drug you take rather than one, it does not close when funding runs out, and with full Extra Help a covered brand-name drug costs about $12.65 in 2026. Apply for Extra Help first and treat the GSK program as the route for people who do not qualify for it — that is the sequence GSK\'s own rules imply.',

If your doses are given in a clinic instead, the billing route can differ, so ask your prescriber\'s office which benefit applies to you. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and the <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/prescription-payment-plan">Medicare Prescription Payment Plan</a> can spread that across the year.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why are GSK\'s rules for Nucala different from its rules for Anoro or Breo?',
      answer:
        'Because GSK sorts its medicines into categories and writes a separate Medicare rule for each. Nucala is a "specialty" product: no prescription-spending threshold, an income limit of $63,840 for one person — but anyone enrolled in Medicare Extra Help is excluded, along with Medicaid, VA, DOD and TRICARE. The Ellipta inhalers are "general" products: you must have paid $600 for prescriptions this calendar year and income is capped at $47,880 for one person, but Extra Help is not a disqualifier. Same foundation, genuinely different rules — so read the page for your own medicine.',
    },
    {
      question: 'I have Extra Help. Can I get Nucala through GSK?',
      answer:
        'No. GSK\'s Nucala patient assistance route requires that you are not enrolled in Medicare Extra Help. That sounds like bad news but usually is not: Extra Help lowers cost-sharing on every covered drug you take rather than one, it cannot close when funding runs out, and with full Extra Help a covered brand-name drug costs about $12.65 in 2026 — which for a specialty-tier biologic is a better outcome than most manufacturer programs deliver. Keep the Extra Help and use <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">that route</a> instead.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic or biosimilar for Nucala?',
      answer:
        'No. DailyMed lists exactly one labelled mepolizumab product — GSK\'s Nucala. There is no generic and no biosimilar, so there is no lower-tier version to ask your prescriber about. That is part of why the specialty-tier coinsurance on this medication is difficult, and why the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan and Extra Help carry so much of the weight here.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Nucala right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Nucala on its Asthma fund, its COPD fund and the health-equity version of each — all four closed, each paying $1,200 guaranteed up to $3,500. HealthWell\'s Asthma and COPD – Medicare Access funds were closed too, and Good Days has no applicable fund. No foundation on this list runs a fund specific to eosinophilic disease. Set alerts, but note that a $3,500 ceiling goes further against an inhaler copay than against specialty-tier coinsurance.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Nucala part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Nucala or mepolizumab row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028. Two other GSK respiratory products are on those lists — Breo Ellipta and Trelegy Ellipta for 2027, and Anoro Ellipta for 2028 — but Nucala is not among them.
