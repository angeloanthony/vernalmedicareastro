  // evolocumab — PCSK9 inhibitor monoclonal antibody (Repatha US PI).
  drugClass: ['pcsk9'],
  description:
    'Repatha is an injectable PCSK9 inhibitor — a monoclonal antibody given every two weeks or once a month — that lowers LDL ("bad") cholesterol and reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke in people at increased cardiovascular risk, usually when statins alone are not enough.',
  usedFor: [
    'Reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke, unstable angina requiring hospitalization and coronary revascularization in adults at increased risk of cardiovascular events',
    'Lowering LDL cholesterol, with diet and exercise, in adults with hypercholesterolemia',
    'Lowering LDL cholesterol in adults and children 10 and older with heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Repatha is a brand-only biologic with no biosimilar — FDA\'s Purple Book lists no competing product and shows exclusivity running to September 2028. Part D plans place it on a brand or specialty tier, usually with coinsurance rather than a flat copay and often behind prior authorization requiring a documented statin trial. Amgen reports that about 84% of Medicare prescriptions for Repatha cost $50 or less a month in 2025 — but the remaining share, typically people early in the year or on a high coinsurance tier, can pay far more until the $2,100 Part D cap.',
  medicareContext:
    'Repatha is generally covered under Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans for its approved uses, commonly with prior authorization or step therapy after statins. It is not one of the drugs with a Medicare-negotiated price in 2026 or 2027, so your cost is set entirely by your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, capped at $2,100 out of pocket in 2026. Amgen states that Part D enrollees who qualify for Extra Help can expect to pay $12.65 or less a month.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes — and Repatha has more open doors than most drugs we have checked. TotalAssist\'s Hypercholesterolemia fund was open and lists Repatha; Amgen\'s cash-pay AmgenNow price is open to Medicare patients (with strings attached); and the Amgen Safety Net Foundation provides Repatha free to eligible uninsured patients, with a Medicare Part D pathway that Amgen describes for "certain products" — confirm by phone whether Repatha is one. The Repatha Co-pay Card excludes Medicare. HealthWell\'s cholesterol fund was closed.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Repatha?',
      answer:
        'Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Repatha for high cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, usually with prior authorization requiring a documented statin trial or intolerance. It is not a negotiated-price drug, so your cost is your plan\'s tier and coinsurance, capped at $2,100 out of pocket in 2026. Amgen reports about 84% of Medicare prescriptions for Repatha cost $50 or less a month. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can lower that to $12.65 or less.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Repatha patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Amgen Safety Net Foundation provides Repatha free to eligible patients with household income at or below $47,880 (one person) or $64,920 (two). Its Medicare Part D pathway — for patients who cannot afford their out-of-pocket costs, are not eligible for Extra Help or Medicaid, have met their plan\'s prior-authorization rules and have no other support — is described for "certain products"; Amgen\'s site does not say whether Repatha is one, so call 1-800-932-3060 to confirm before applying.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Repatha Co-pay Card (RepathaReady) with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Amgen\'s terms state the Repatha Co-pay Card "is not valid for patients whose Repatha prescription is paid for in whole or in part by Medicare, Medicaid, or any other federal or state healthcare program," and its cost page lists Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, Medigap and VA among the excluded programs. The Medicare routes are TotalAssist, the Amgen foundation, AmgenNow and Extra Help.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Repatha right now?',
      answer:
        'Yes. On August 26, 2026 TotalAssist\'s Hypercholesterolemia fund was open — $1,900 guaranteed, up to $3,800 — for people with government insurance (Medicare counts), income at or below 500% of the federal poverty level and a hypercholesterolemia diagnosis. Repatha is on its list. HealthWell\'s Hypercholesterolemia – Medicare Access fund also lists Repatha but was closed. Funds close without notice, so apply promptly.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the $239 Repatha price?',
      answer:
        'It is the AmgenNow cash price Amgen announced in October 2025 — "nearly 60% lower" than list price — available through a GoodRx coupon to anyone, including Medicare patients. Part D enrollees who use it must agree not to bill their plan, not to count the cost toward their Part D cap, to tell their plan, and to buy all their Amgen medicines that year outside their government insurance. amgennow.com does not print the price, so confirm it at the pharmacy.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic or biosimilar for Repatha?',
      answer:
        'No. FDA\'s Purple Book (August 2026 data) lists no licensed biosimilar of evolocumab, and shows Repatha\'s reference-product exclusivity running to September 2028. Repatha remains brand-only in the U.S.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if the fund is closed?',
      answer:
        'TotalAssist offers text, email or phone notifications when a fund opens, with no waitlist or queue; HealthWell offers alerts for each fund. While you wait, the routes that do not depend on a fund balance are Extra Help, the Amgen foundation (if you qualify), AmgenNow\'s cash price, an appeal or formulary exception through your doctor, and a Part D plan comparison in the fall.
