// Victoza (liraglutide) — Novo Nordisk. Independently researched 2026-08-26.
// Batch 8 — a NEW slug.
//
// Victoza is the counter-example to every other Novo Nordisk record in this
// batch, and that is why it earns a page.
//
//  1. VICTOZA IS NOT ON THE NOVO NORDISK PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. The
//     program's own available-products list (form NNIPAP_11_01012026) names the
//     insulins, Ozempic and Xultophy — and no Victoza. Tresiba and NovoLog, from
//     the same manufacturer, ARE on it. A reader who has been told "Novo Nordisk
//     has a patient assistance program" is being told something true that does not
//     apply to their medication.
//  2. THE REASON IS ALSO THE SOLUTION: liraglutide is now comprehensively
//     generic. DailyMed lists 22 labelled liraglutide products across 13 distinct
//     labelers — Teva, Hikma, Lupin, Biocon, Meitheal, Northstar and others — and
//     the federal TrumpRx site prices generic liraglutide at $133.58 while listing
//     no brand Victoza at all.
//  3. Victoza is a GLP-1, so this record must not be confused with the
//     weight-management GLP-1 records on this site. Victoza's indication is
//     glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes, which is what Part D covers GLP-1s
//     for; it is not a weight-loss product and the weight-management rules do not
//     govern it.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Victoza is a once-daily injected GLP-1 medicine for type 2 diabetes. It is worth being clear about two things straight away: it is a diabetes medicine rather than a weight-loss one, and unlike Novo Nordisk\'s other diabetes products it has no manufacturer patient assistance program — because liraglutide is now widely available as a generic.',
  usedFor: [
    'Improving blood sugar control in adults and children aged 10 and over with type 2 diabetes, alongside diet and exercise — confirm the details that apply to your prescription with your prescriber',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Brand Victoza sits on a brand tier in most Part D plans. But the cost picture here has changed more than for any other medication in this batch: liraglutide is comprehensively generic, with 22 labelled products from 13 different labelers on DailyMed, and the federal TrumpRx site prices generic liraglutide at $133.58 while carrying no listing for the brand at all. That competition is also why Novo Nordisk no longer supports the brand through its patient assistance program.',
  medicareContext:
    'Victoza is an injection you give yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan — and it is covered on the ordinary basis, because its indication is type 2 diabetes. That distinction matters: Part D covers GLP-1 medicines for type 2 diabetes, and the separate rules that govern GLP-1s prescribed for weight management do not apply to Victoza. It is not a Medicare-negotiated drug: CMS\'s selected-drug file has no Victoza or liraglutide row for 2026, 2027 or 2028, which is unsurprising for a medicine that already has generic competition. Other GLP-1s are on those lists — Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy for 2027, Trulicity for 2028 — so do not read across from them. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Not from the manufacturer, and that is the most useful thing on this page. Victoza is NOT on Novo Nordisk\'s patient assistance program list, even though Tresiba, NovoLog and Ozempic are.

        'Novo Nordisk\'s program does have a Medicare pathway — it is one of the few that requires you to have Medicare or no insurance rather than excluding Medicare — but that pathway is irrelevant to Victoza, because the program only supplies medicines on its list. It is worth knowing that Novo Nordisk has been narrowing this program on the GLP-1 side generally: it also states that "Medicare beneficiaries with prescription drug coverage will no longer be eligible to receive Ozempic through the Patient Assistance Program". So the direction of travel for Novo Nordisk GLP-1s and Medicare is away from free-drug support and toward the generic and the plan.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Victoza?',
      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Victoza, usually with brand Victoza on a brand tier and generic liraglutide on a much lower generic tier. Because Victoza\'s indication is type 2 diabetes, it is covered on the ordinary basis: Part D covers GLP-1 medicines prescribed for type 2 diabetes, and the separate rules that apply to GLP-1s prescribed for weight management do not govern it. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Victoza patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Victoza is not on the Novo Nordisk Patient Assistance Program\'s available-products list — we read that list, form NNIPAP_11_01012026, on August 26, 2026. The program covers Novo Nordisk\'s insulins plus Ozempic and Xultophy, and Victoza appears nowhere on it. This catches people out because Novo Nordisk genuinely does run a substantial free-medicine program, and it is unusually welcoming to Medicare beneficiaries — it just does not include this medication. Ask about generic liraglutide instead.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Victoza?',
      answer:
        'Yes, and it is thoroughly established. DailyMed lists 22 labelled liraglutide products across 13 distinct labelers, including Teva, Hikma, Lupin, Biocon, Meitheal and Northstar Rx. The federal TrumpRx site prices "Liraglutide (Generic for Victoza)" at $133.58 and carries no listing for brand Victoza at all. TotalAssist lists generic liraglutide on the same Type 2 diabetes fund as the brand. Since there is no manufacturer assistance program for this medication, the generic is by far the largest saving available.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Victoza a weight-loss drug?',
      answer:
        'No. Victoza is a GLP-1 medicine indicated for improving blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes, and that is how Medicare covers it. Some other GLP-1 products are prescribed for weight management and are subject to different Medicare rules; Victoza is not one of them. If you have read about Medicare and GLP-1s for weight loss, those rules do not apply to a Victoza prescription written for diabetes.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Victoza part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Victoza or liraglutide row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028 — unsurprising for a medicine that already has generic competition, since the program selects drugs without it. Other GLP-1s are on those lists: Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy were selected together for 2027, and Trulicity for 2028. Do not read those prices across to Victoza. See <a href="/prescription-drug-assistance.html">all prescription assistance options</a>.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Victoza right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Victoza 2-Pak, Victoza 3-Pak and generic liraglutide on its Type 2 diabetes fund and the health-equity version, both closed, each with a $1,500 guaranteed and $2,000 maximum award. HealthWell\'s Type 2 Diabetes fund was closed too, and Good Days has no diabetes fund. Given how widely available generic liraglutide now is, a grant is likely to matter less here than for most medications on this site.',
