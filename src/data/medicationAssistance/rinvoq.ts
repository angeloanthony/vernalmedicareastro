// Rinvoq (upadacitinib) — AbbVie. Independently researched 2026-08-26. Every
// program below was read on the official source cited with it. Batch 3
// (spec §24 #15) — a NEW page.
//
// Rinvoq is the first record in the project to carry the 'jak-inhibitor'
// class. That is not a cosmetic distinction: it is a tablet, not an injected
// biologic, so it must not inherit the 'biologic' key from its shelf-mates
// Humira, Enbrel and Skyrizi. Confirmed against the label — "RINVOQ/RINVOQ LQ
// is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor."
//
// It shares myAbbVie Assist with Skyrizi. The program facts were re-read on
// Rinvoq's own application (R-APP1-25D-2, April 2025) and on AbbVie's
// available-programs list rather than copied across, because AbbVie has
// demonstrated it removes individual medicines from that list — see the Humira
// record.
//
// RESEARCH NOTE (access): www.abbvie.com serves a Cloudflare block page; the
// apex host abbvie.com serves the same pages, and AbbVie's application PDFs
// are readable under abbvie.com/content/dam/.

  description:
    'Rinvoq is a once-daily tablet in the JAK inhibitor class, used across a wide set of immune-driven conditions — rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, eczema, ulcerative colitis, Crohn\'s disease, spondyloarthritis and giant cell arteritis. Most of its approvals are second-line: the label generally expects that a TNF blocker was tried first, or was not appropriate for you.',
  usedFor: [
    'Moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in adults after an inadequate response to one or more TNF blockers',
    'Active psoriatic arthritis in adults and patients 2 and older after an inadequate response to one or more TNF blockers',
    'Refractory moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults and patients 12 and older',
    'Moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and Crohn\'s disease in adults after an inadequate response to one or more TNF blockers',
    'Active ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in adults',
    'Giant cell arteritis, and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and juvenile psoriatic arthritis in children',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Rinvoq is a brand-only specialty tablet with no generic, so Part D plans place it on a specialty tier where you pay a percentage of a high price rather than a flat copay. The second-line labelling adds a second cost: plans commonly require prior authorization and documentation that a TNF blocker was tried first, which can delay a fill even when the money is arranged.',
  medicareContext:
    'Rinvoq is generally covered under Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans, usually on a specialty tier and almost always with prior authorization or step therapy, because the label itself expects a TNF blocker to have been tried first. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan can spread that across the year. Rinvoq is not on the Medicare-negotiated drug lists for 2026 or 2027. One practical note: because it is a tablet dispensed through a pharmacy, Rinvoq runs through your Part D drug benefit rather than Part B — simpler than the biologics it competes with.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes, and the manufacturer route is open. AbbVie\'s myAbbVie Assist program lists Rinvoq and accepts people with Medicare, subject to an Extra Help rule for lower incomes.

      'myAbbVie Assist: Rinvoq is on AbbVie\'s current available-medicines list. AbbVie describes the program as being for people who are "uninsured, receiving coverage through Medicare, or your health insurance isn\'t enough to cover the cost."',
      'Rinvoq.com puts the Medicare path plainly: "If you\'re not eligible for Extra Help, RINVOQ may still be available at no additional cost" — call an Insurance Specialist at 1-800-2RINVOQ to start.',
      'The Medicare condition: with household income below 150% of the federal poverty level you are not eligible for myAbbVie Assist unless you applied for Extra Help and were denied, and the denial letter must come with your application.',
      'The consequence to weigh: AbbVie\'s terms say a Part D enrollee must not buy Rinvoq through their Medicare plan while enrolled, receives no true-out-of-pocket (TrOOP) credit for the free medicine, and that the program will notify the drug plan.',
      'RINVOQ Complete Savings Card: commercially insured patients only, with a $14,000 annual maximum. AbbVie\'s terms exclude Medicare including Part D, Medicare Advantage, Medigap, Medicaid, TRICARE, DoD and VA.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Rinvoq?',
      answer:
        'Generally yes. Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans cover Rinvoq, usually on a specialty tier and almost always with prior authorization or step therapy — the label itself expects that a TNF blocker was tried first for most indications. Because it is a tablet dispensed at a pharmacy, it runs through your Part D drug benefit rather than Part B. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can lower a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Rinvoq patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Yes. AbbVie\'s myAbbVie Assist program lists Rinvoq among its available medicines and accepts Medicare beneficiaries. Rinvoq.com states it directly: "If you\'re not eligible for Extra Help, RINVOQ may still be available at no additional cost." One rule applies specifically to Medicare — if your household income is below 150% of the federal poverty level you are not eligible unless you have applied for Extra Help and been denied, with the denial letter attached. Call 1-800-222-6885 for the application, or 1-800-2RINVOQ for an Insurance Specialist.',
    },
    {
      question: 'If AbbVie gives me Rinvoq free, does that count toward my Part D out-of-pocket cap?',
      answer:
        'No. AbbVie\'s terms of participation require that you not purchase Rinvoq under your Medicare plan while enrolled, that you not submit claims or seek true out-of-pocket (TrOOP) credit for the medicine provided, and they state that myAbbVie Assist will inform your Medicare drug plan that you are receiving the medication at no cost outside the Part D benefit. The medicine is genuinely free — it simply does not move you toward the $2,100 cap for your other drugs.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the RINVOQ Complete Savings Card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. AbbVie\'s terms state the copay assistance program is not available to patients receiving reimbursement under any federal, state or government-funded insurance program, and name Medicare including Part D, Medicare Advantage, Medigap, Medicaid, TRICARE, DoD and VA. If you begin such coverage while holding a card, AbbVie asks you to call 1-800-2RINVOQ to stop participation. Federal anti-kickback rules are the reason — see the key terms lower on this page.',
    },
    {
      question: 'AbbVie stopped covering Humira. Does that affect Rinvoq?',
      answer:
        'No. AbbVie removed HUMIRA from myAbbVie Assist for new patients effective July 1, 2026, but the program continues and Rinvoq remains on AbbVie\'s available-medicines list — AbbVie in fact names Rinvoq as one of the treatments that may be available through the program to patients affected by the Humira change. Because AbbVie has shown it will remove a medicine from that list, check Rinvoq is still on it before you apply.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Rinvoq right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Rinvoq under six funds — rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, atopic dermatitis, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease — and HealthWell lists it on the AutoImmune and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Medicare Access funds. All eight were closed to new applicants, as was HealthWell\'s giant cell arteritis fund. Good Days has no matching fund. Sign up for alerts at both foundations; with this many matching funds, one reopening is more likely than for most medications.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Rinvoq?',
      answer:
        'No. Upadacitinib is brand-only in the United States, with no generic on the market. Rinvoq is a JAK inhibitor rather than a biologic, so biosimilars are not the relevant comparison either. If cost is the problem, ask whether another medicine for your condition sits on a lower tier of your plan, and see <a href="/prescription-drug-assistance.html">all prescription assistance options</a>.',
