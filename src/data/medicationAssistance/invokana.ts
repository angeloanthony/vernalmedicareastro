// Invokana (canagliflozin) — Janssen Pharmaceuticals, part of Johnson & Johnson.
// Independently researched 2026-08-26. Batch 8 — a NEW slug.
//
// Invokana completes the SGLT2 set on this site alongside Farxiga and Jardiance,
// and the comparison is the point rather than a side note. Farxiga and Jardiance
// are BOTH Medicare-negotiated drugs, selected in the first cycle with prices in
// effect since January 1, 2026. Invokana is not on any CMS list. Three medicines
// in the same class, and the Medicare arithmetic differs sharply between them.
//
// A second and unusual finding: there is still NO true generic canagliflozin.
// DailyMed returns five canagliflozin records across three labelers, but the only
// brands are INVOKANA and INVOKAMET — the rest are repackagers of the brand, not
// independent generics. That is a materially different position from Januvia
// (generic sitagliptin exists) and worth stating plainly, because "SGLT2s have
// generics now" is a reasonable thing to have heard and a wrong thing to act on.
//
// Research gap carried honestly: the Johnson & Johnson Patient Assistance
// Foundation covers Invokana — J&J's own Invokana site says so — but its income
// limits could not be read at the source. patientassistanceinfo.com redirects to a
// PDF whose text is font-encoded, the enrolment form is a fillable PDF with the
// same problem, and portal.jnjwithme.com renders client-side. The income figures
// are therefore recorded as unverified rather than lifted from a third-party site.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Invokana is a once-daily SGLT2 inhibitor tablet for type 2 diabetes, in the same class as Farxiga and Jardiance. The class similarity is where most people start and where the useful differences begin: Invokana has no generic, and unlike its two closest competitors it is not a Medicare-negotiated drug — so what you pay for it can differ substantially from what you would pay for the others.',
  usedFor: [
    'Improving blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes, alongside diet and exercise',
    'Reducing cardiovascular and kidney-related risks in adults with type 2 diabetes who meet the label\'s criteria — confirm which indications apply to your prescription with your prescriber',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Invokana is a brand-only tablet taken indefinitely, and it sits in an unusual position within its own class. There is no generic canagliflozin: DailyMed\'s canagliflozin records resolve to just two brands, Invokana and the combination Invokamet, with the remaining entries being repackagers of the brand rather than independent generics. And where Farxiga and Jardiance both have Medicare-negotiated prices in effect since January 1, 2026, Invokana has none. Those two facts together are why an SGLT2 prescription can cost very different amounts depending on which one you were written for.',
  medicareContext:
    'Invokana is a tablet you take yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, usually on a brand tier. It is not a Medicare-negotiated drug — CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Invokana or canagliflozin row for 2026, 2027 or 2028. That is worth checking rather than assuming, because two other SGLT2 inhibitors, Farxiga and Jardiance, were both selected in the first negotiation cycle and have had negotiated prices in effect since January 1, 2026. If cost is the obstacle, the question worth asking your prescriber is whether a negotiated-price SGLT2 would work as well for you — a clinical decision, but one where the Medicare arithmetic genuinely differs. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan can spread what you owe across the year.',

    verdict:
      'Probably — the Johnson & Johnson Patient Assistance Foundation covers Invokana and describes itself as serving people with "government coverage that does not fully meet your needs", which is a Medicare-shaped description.

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Invokana?',
      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Invokana, usually on a brand tier. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65 — which matters more here than for some SGLT2 inhibitors, because Invokana has no negotiated price and no generic.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Invokana part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No, and this is the fact most worth knowing about Invokana on Medicare. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Invokana or canagliflozin row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028. Two other SGLT2 inhibitors were selected in the very first negotiation cycle and have had negotiated prices in effect since January 1, 2026: Farxiga and Jardiance. Three medicines in the same class, and the Medicare arithmetic is genuinely different between them — which is worth raising with your prescriber if cost is the obstacle.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Invokana?',
      answer:
        'No. DailyMed returns five canagliflozin records, but they resolve to only two brands — Invokana and the combination Invokamet — with the remaining entries being repackagers of the brand rather than independent generic products. This surprises people because several diabetes brands have gone generic recently, including sitagliptin, the active ingredient in Januvia. For canagliflozin specifically there is nothing to switch to at a generic tier.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there an Invokana patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'The Johnson & Johnson Patient Assistance Foundation covers Invokana and supplies it at no cost for up to a year, and J&J describes it as being for people who are "uninsured or have commercial, employer-sponsored, or government coverage that does not fully meet your needs" — wording that reads as open to a Medicare beneficiary facing unaffordable cost-sharing. What we could not confirm is the income limit: J&J\'s quick-reference guide and enrolment form are PDFs whose text could not be read, and its enrolment portal renders client-side. Call 877-468-6526 and ask for the figure for your household size rather than relying on a number from a third-party site.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the $0 Invokana savings card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. J&J\'s terms say the savings program is "Not valid for patients using Medicare, Medicaid, or other government-funded programs to pay for their medications." This catches people out at 65: a $0 monthly copay on commercial insurance disappears the moment Medicare begins, and there is no equivalent Medicare version of the card. The J&J route that does remain open is the patient assistance foundation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Invokana right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Invokana, Invokamet and Invokamet XR on its Type 2 diabetes fund and the health-equity version, both closed, each with a $1,500 guaranteed and $2,000 maximum award. HealthWell\'s Type 2 Diabetes fund was closed too. Good Days has no diabetes program, although it does run a Chronic Kidney Disease program — if kidney protection is the reason you were prescribed Invokana, that is worth a question to Good Days directly.
