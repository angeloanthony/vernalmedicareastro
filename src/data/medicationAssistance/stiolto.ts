// Stiolto Respimat (tiotropium bromide / olodaterol) — Boehringer Ingelheim.
// Independently researched 2026-08-26. Batch 8 — a NEW slug.
//
// Boehringer Ingelheim blocks automated access, exactly as the Spiriva and Ofev
// records recorded in Batch 6. On the checked date boehringer-ingelheim.com,
// pradaxa.com and stiolto.com all returned Incapsula block pages, and bicares.com
// served a parked placeholder. The project rule applies unchanged: an
// inaccessible official source produces `verify`, never a borrowed fact from a
// sibling drug or another manufacturer.
//
// What COULD be established, and it is more than for Spiriva:
//   • The BI Cares Foundation's own therapy list, supplied by the foundation to
//     the PhRMA-run helpingpatients.org directory, names "Stiolto Respimat spray"
//     alongside Jardiance, Ofev, Pradaxa, Spiriva HandiHaler, Spiriva Respimat and
//     Tradjenta. That database was last updated September 15, 2025, and the page
//     says so.
//   • docs.boehringer-ingelheim.com — the one BI host that answers — serves the
//     STIOLTO RESPIMAT Savings Card terms as a PDF. They are readable, and they
//     are stale: the document carries "Program expiration on 12/31/2024". The
//     Medicare exclusion language is quoted verbatim; the dollar figures are
//     reported as what the expired document says, not as current terms.
//
// TAXONOMY: `lama-laba`, shared with Anoro Ellipta. Label: "STIOLTO RESPIMAT is a
// combination of tiotropium bromide, an anticholinergic and olodaterol, a
// long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA)", and "STIOLTO RESPIMAT is not
// indicated to treat asthma" — which is why it appears on the COPD funds only.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Stiolto Respimat is a once-daily maintenance inhaler for COPD that combines two long-acting bronchodilators — tiotropium, the same molecule as Spiriva, plus olodaterol — in a soft-mist Respimat device. It contains no steroid and is licensed for COPD only, which is what places it on the COPD charitable funds rather than the asthma ones.',
  usedFor: [
    'Long-term, once-daily maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Stiolto Respimat is a brand-only inhaler — DailyMed labels no generic version of the tiotropium/olodaterol combination — and Part D plans generally place it on a brand tier for treatment that continues indefinitely. The manufacturer picture is harder to pin down than for most medications on this site, because Boehringer Ingelheim blocks automated access to its patient-support pages, so the program terms below could not be read at the source and are recorded as unverified rather than guessed at.',
  medicareContext:
    'Stiolto Respimat is an inhaler you use yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, usually on a brand tier. It is not a Medicare-negotiated drug: CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Stiolto, tiotropium or olodaterol row for 2026, 2027 or 2028. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan can spread what you owe across the year. One practical note specific to this inhaler: tiotropium on its own is available as generic Spiriva, so if cost is the obstacle it is worth asking your prescriber whether the combination is doing something a single bronchodilator would not.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Probably — but we could not confirm the terms at the source, and this page says so rather than filling the gap. Boehringer Ingelheim\'s own foundation lists Stiolto Respimat among the therapies it offers, but BI blocks automated access to its program pages, so the current eligibility rules and the current savings-card terms are unverified. Both applicable charitable funds were closed.',

      'Stiolto Respimat Savings Card: the terms BI publishes as a PDF are readable but EXPIRED — they carry "Program expiration on 12/31/2024". They exclude Medicare in any case.',

  charitableSummary:
    'The charitable picture for Stiolto Respimat is the standard COPD one and it was shut on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Stiolto on its COPD fund and COPD health equity fund, each paying $1,200 guaranteed up to $3,500, and both were closed; HealthWell\'s COPD – Medicare Access fund was closed too; Good Days runs no COPD fund. What makes the charitable side unusually important for this particular inhaler is the state of the manufacturer side: because Boehringer Ingelheim\'s program terms could not be verified, the foundations are the routes whose rules you can actually read today. Set alerts on TotalAssist and HealthWell, call the Boehringer Cares Foundation to close the gap this page cannot close, and apply for Extra Help in the meantime.',
  extraHelpNote:
    'Extra Help carries more weight for Stiolto than for medications with a well-documented manufacturer program, because there is no published BI rule to weigh it against. There is a real question worth asking the Boehringer Cares Foundation when you call — whether Extra Help enrolment affects your eligibility — since manufacturers differ on that point and BI\'s answer is not published. In the meantime, apply for Extra Help: with full Extra Help a covered brand-name drug costs about $12.65 in 2026, and the subsidy applies to every covered drug you take rather than one.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Stiolto Respimat?',
      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Stiolto Respimat, usually on a brand tier. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Stiolto Respimat patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Boehringer Ingelheim\'s foundation lists Stiolto Respimat among the therapies it offers, so a program almost certainly covers it — but we could not confirm its current terms. On August 26, 2026 every Boehringer Ingelheim patient-support page we tried returned a block page to automated access, and bicares.com served a placeholder. Rather than repeat figures from a sibling drug or a third-party site, this page records the gap and tells you to call. Ask specifically whether Medicare Part D enrollees may apply, whether Extra Help disqualifies you, and what the income limit is.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why does this page say "unverified" when other sites quote exact income limits?',
      answer:
        'Because we could not read those limits on Boehringer Ingelheim\'s own pages, and this project does not publish an assistance figure it has not seen at the source. Third-party directories do carry numbers for BI\'s program, but they are secondary, they age, and an out-of-date income limit can wrongly convince someone they do not qualify. The one BI document we could read — the Stiolto savings card terms — turned out to carry a 2024 expiry date, which is a fair illustration of why the caution is warranted.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Stiolto Respimat?',
      answer:
        'No. DailyMed lists a single labelled tiotropium/olodaterol product, Boehringer Ingelheim\'s Stiolto Respimat. However, tiotropium on its own — the Spiriva molecule, and one of Stiolto\'s two ingredients — is available generically. Whether a single bronchodilator would control your COPD as well as the combination is a clinical question for your prescriber, but it is a reasonable one to raise if cost is the obstacle.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Stiolto savings card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. The card\'s terms exclude prescriptions "eligible to be reimbursed, in whole or in part, by any governmental program such as Medicaid, Medicare, Medigap, the Retiree Drug Subsidy Program, VA, DOD, TRICARE, or any state patient or pharmaceutical assistance program." Two further points: the terms we could read carry a program expiration of 12/31/2024, so they are not current; and manufacturer copay cards are closed to Medicare across the board under federal anti-kickback rules, so no future version will change that answer.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Stiolto Respimat right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Stiolto Respimat on its COPD fund and COPD health equity fund and both were closed, each with a $1,200 guaranteed and $3,500 maximum award. HealthWell\'s COPD – Medicare Access fund was closed too, and Good Days has no COPD fund. Because the manufacturer route for this inhaler is the one we could not verify, the foundations are worth watching more closely here than usual.
