  // semaglutide — GLP-1 receptor agonist (Ozempic US prescribing information).
  drugClass: ['glp-1'],
  description:
    'Ozempic is a once-weekly injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist for type 2 diabetes. The same molecule is sold as Wegovy for weight management and as Rybelsus tablets; Medicare treats those uses differently, and Ozempic itself is covered by Part D for diabetes.',
  usedFor: [
    'Improving blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes, along with diet and exercise',
    'Reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and known heart disease',
    'Reducing the risk of kidney disease worsening, kidney failure and cardiovascular death in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Ozempic is a high-list-price brand injectable that Part D plans usually place on a high tier with prior authorization confirming type 2 diabetes, so copays or coinsurance can be substantial until the $2,100 annual cap. In 2026 Novo Nordisk also stopped supplying Ozempic to Medicare enrollees through its patient assistance program, closing the route many beneficiaries relied on.',
  medicareContext:
    'Medicare Part D covers GLP-1 medicines such as Ozempic when prescribed for type 2 diabetes, not for weight loss alone. Semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy) was selected in the second cycle of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program: CMS published a negotiated price of $274 for a 30-day supply (versus a $959 list price in 2024) that takes effect January 1, 2027. Until then, your cost depends on your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing. The Medicare GLP-1 Bridge ($50 a month) does not include Ozempic and excludes people with type 2 diabetes.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'For most people on Medicare, not through the usual routes in 2026: Novo Nordisk\'s patient assistance program no longer provides Ozempic to Medicare beneficiaries with drug coverage, the savings offer excludes government insurance, and the type 2 diabetes charity funds were closed to new applicants when we checked. What remains: Novo\'s self-pay pricing through NovoCare Pharmacy (open to Medicare enrollees paying cash), Medicare Extra Help, a negotiated Part D price arriving in 2027, and fund notifications for when a diabetes fund reopens.',

      question: 'What is the NovoCare Pharmacy self-pay price, and can I use it with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'New patients pay $199 a month for the first two fills of 0.25 mg or 0.5 mg (through December 31, 2026), then $349 a month for 0.25–1 mg or $499 a month for 2 mg. Novo states government-insured patients may use it if they self-pay and process outside their insurance; you agree not to seek reimbursement or count the cost toward your plan\'s deductible or out-of-pocket limit. Compare it with your Part D copay before switching.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does the $50-a-month Medicare GLP-1 program cover Ozempic?',
      answer:
        'No. The Medicare GLP-1 Bridge (July 1, 2026 – December 31, 2027) covers Foundayo, Wegovy and the Zepbound KwikPen for weight management and excludes people with type 2 diabetes. Ozempic is not an eligible Bridge drug; if you take Ozempic for diabetes, your route is regular Part D coverage.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Ozempic right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. Ozempic is on the type 2 diabetes fund lists at TotalAssist and HealthWell, but both funds were closed to new applicants, and Good Days has no diabetes program. Sign up for notifications at totalassist.org/notify and on the HealthWell fund page so you hear when one reopens.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can my doctor\'s office apply for me?',
      answer:
        'For TotalAssist and HealthWell you (the patient) apply, and the foundation verifies the diagnosis with your provider; the Novo PAP has a patient portion and a prescriber portion. Your doctor\'s office also handles the prior-authorization request most Part D plans require for Ozempic and can request a formulary exception. Vernal Medicare can help you work through the options, free.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if the fund is closed?',
      answer:
        'TotalAssist offers text, email or phone notifications with no waitlist or queue, and HealthWell says closed funds reopen as funding is replenished. While you wait: apply for Extra Help, weigh the self-pay price against your plan copay, ask your doctor about a formulary exception, and compare Part D plans in the fall. See <a href="/prescription-drug-assistance.html">all prescription assistance options</a>.',
