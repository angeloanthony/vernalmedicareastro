// Lantus (insulin glargine) — Sanofi. Independently researched 2026-08-26.
// Batch 8 — a NEW slug. D10 is resolved: one ordinary record per insulin brand.
//
// This record deliberately does NOT lead with the $35 Part D insulin cap. That
// cap applies to every insulin under a Medicare drug plan, it is not
// brand-specific assistance, and /insulin-cost-medicare-vernal.html is the site's
// resource for it. It appears once here, in `medicareContext`, as background.
//
// What IS specific to Lantus, and what this page is for:
//
//  1. THE TrOOP TRAP. Sanofi's Insulins Valyou Savings Program sells Lantus for
//     $35 per 30-day supply to people "who are insured by a prescription plan but
//     are not using such insurance and will be paying the full retail price." A
//     Medicare beneficiary CAN use that by paying cash outside Part D. But
//     Sanofi's own terms then say: "You may not seek to have your out-of-pocket
//     costs or the full retail price of the Sanofi Insulin count toward your
//     deductible, true-out-of-pocket (TrOOP), maximum out-of-pocket (MOOP), or any
//     other out-of-pocket caps." So the cash route buys a lower monthly price at
//     the cost of progress toward the $2,100 Part D cap. For someone taking other
//     expensive drugs, that trade can be a net loss. This is a real, checkable,
//     decision-changing distinction and it is the spine of the page.
//
//  2. SANOFI PATIENT CONNECTION STATES NO MEDICARE RULE. Its published eligibility
//     is US residency, income ≤400% FPL ($63,840 for one person in 2026), and — for
//     commercially insured patients — no coverage or access to the product. Nothing
//     on its eligibility pages addresses Medicare. Recorded as `unknown`, not
//     guessed at.
//
//  3. Insulin glargine has the deepest follow-on/biosimilar market of any insulin
//     in this batch: Basaglar, Semglee, Rezvoglar, Langlara and an unbranded
//     "Insulin Glargine" all appear on DailyMed alongside Lantus.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Lantus is a long-acting insulin taken once a day to cover your background insulin needs between meals and overnight. It is the original insulin glargine, and it now sits in the most crowded field of any insulin on this site — several follow-on and biosimilar glargine products are on the market, which matters for what you pay.',

    'Improving blood sugar control in adults and children with type 1 diabetes',
    'Improving blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Insulin is taken every day for life, so what looks like a modest monthly figure compounds. Two things pull the cost down for Lantus specifically. First, insulin glargine has the deepest competition of any insulin in this batch — DailyMed lists 20 labelled glargine products across nine labelers, including Basaglar, Semglee, Rezvoglar and Langlara. Second, Sanofi sells Lantus for $35 per 30-day supply outside insurance, and the federal TrumpRx site lists the same $35. The catch with that second route is not the price; it is what paying cash does to your Part D out-of-pocket accounting, which is covered below.',
  medicareContext:
    'Lantus is covered under Medicare Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan. Under federal law, a covered insulin costs no more than $35 for a month\'s supply under a Medicare drug plan, with no deductible applied to it — that applies to insulins generally rather than to Lantus specifically, and our <a href="/insulin-cost-medicare-vernal.html">insulin cost guide</a> covers how it works across products. Two things that ARE specific to Lantus: it is not a Medicare-negotiated drug (CMS\'s selected-drug file has no Lantus, Toujeo or glargine row for 2026, 2027 or 2028 — the only insulin on any of those lists is Novo Nordisk\'s insulin aspart), and the glargine market has enough follow-on products that your plan\'s preferred glargine may not be the brand you started on. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and that cap is what makes Sanofi\'s cash-price route a genuine trade-off rather than a free win.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes, but read the cash-price small print before you take it. Sanofi Patient Connection covers Lantus for people at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, though it states no Medicare rule at all. Sanofi also sells Lantus for $35 cash outside insurance — and its own terms say that spending will not count toward your Part D out-of-pocket cap. Both diabetes charitable funds were closed.',
    points: [
      'Sanofi Patient Connection: Lantus is on its medication list. Income at or below 400% FPL — $63,840 for one person in 2026. The program states NO Medicare rule on its published eligibility pages, so call and ask rather than assuming.',
      'Insulins Valyou Savings Program: $35 per 30-day supply for people "uninsured or... insured by a prescription plan but not using such insurance". You must fill all your Sanofi insulins together each month.',
      'The trade-off that matters: Sanofi\'s terms say you "may not seek to have your out-of-pocket costs... count toward your deductible, true-out-of-pocket (TrOOP), maximum out-of-pocket (MOOP), or any other out-of-pocket caps." Paying cash means no progress toward the $2,100 Part D cap.',

A Medicare beneficiary therefore CAN use it — by stepping outside Part D and paying cash. But Sanofi\'s terms continue: "You may not submit claims for reimbursement to any third-party payor, including any government healthcare plan (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, DOD, VA, TRICARE)... You may not seek to have your out-of-pocket costs or the full retail price of the Sanofi Insulin count toward your deductible, true-out-of-pocket (TrOOP), maximum out-of-pocket (MOOP), or any other out-of-pocket caps associated with any insurance coverage." In plain terms: every dollar you spend this way makes no progress toward the $2,100 Part D out-of-pocket cap. If Lantus is the only expensive drug you take, that may not matter. If you take other costly medications and expect to reach the cap, buying insulin outside your plan can push the date you reach it later — or out of reach entirely — and cost you more across the year than it saves each month.',

First, every one of these is a TYPE 2 fund — if you take Lantus for type 1 diabetes, none of the three foundations has a fund for you, which is a real gap rather than an oversight in our checking. Second, the award sizes here are modest against a year of insulin, and Medicare\'s own $35-a-month insulin cost-sharing already does more for most beneficiaries than a $2,000 grant would. So set an alert, but treat Sanofi Patient Connection, your plan\'s insulin cost-sharing and the glargine-competition question as the routes that matter.',
  extraHelpNote:
    'Extra Help is worth applying for on its own merits, but be realistic about what it adds for insulin specifically. Under a Medicare drug plan a covered insulin already costs no more than $35 a month with no deductible applied, so Extra Help\'s effect on your Lantus is smaller than its effect on most other drugs. Where it earns its keep is everything else you take, and it does not close when funding runs out. One interaction to note: Sanofi Patient Connection publishes no Medicare rule at all, so whether Extra Help affects that application is a question for the phone call rather than something this page can answer.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Lantus?',
      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans cover Lantus, and under federal law a covered insulin costs no more than $35 for a month\'s supply with no deductible applied to it. That rule applies to insulins generally rather than to Lantus specifically; our <a href="/insulin-cost-medicare-vernal.html">insulin cost guide</a> explains how it works and which products are covered. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Sanofi offers Lantus for $35 cash. Should I take it if I have Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Only after doing one calculation. Sanofi\'s Insulins Valyou Savings Program is "only valid for those who are uninsured or those who are insured by a prescription plan but are not using such insurance and will be paying the full retail price" — so you can use it with Medicare by paying cash outside your plan. But Sanofi\'s terms also say you "may not seek to have your out-of-pocket costs... count toward your deductible, true-out-of-pocket (TrOOP), maximum out-of-pocket (MOOP), or any other out-of-pocket caps." Your Medicare drug plan already caps a covered insulin at $35 a month, and that spending counts toward your $2,100 annual cap. So if you take other expensive medications, buying insulin outside your plan can delay or prevent you reaching that cap and cost you more overall.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Lantus patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Sanofi Patient Connection covers Lantus and has a clear income test — an annual household income at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, which is $63,840 for one person in the 48 states and DC in 2026. What it does not have is a published Medicare rule: none of the criteria on its eligibility pages mentions Medicare at all. The program describes itself as being for uninsured or functionally uninsured patients. Call 1-888-847-4877 and ask directly rather than assuming either way.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why are there two different $35 Sanofi offers, and which one applies to me?',
      answer:
        'They are different programs with different rules that happen to quote the same figure. The Sanofi Insulins Co-pay Savings Program is a commercial copay card, and its terms exclude prescriptions covered "under Medicare, Medicaid, VA, DOD, TRICARE" — Medicare beneficiaries cannot use it. The Insulins Valyou Savings Program is a cash price for people not using insurance, and a Medicare beneficiary can use it by paying out of pocket. If you have Medicare, the copay card is closed to you and the cash route is open but carries the out-of-pocket-cap trade-off described above.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic or biosimilar for Lantus?',
      answer:
        'Insulin glargine has more competition than any other insulin covered on this site. DailyMed lists 20 labelled glargine products across nine labelers, including Basaglar, Semglee, Rezvoglar, Langlara and an unbranded insulin glargine, alongside Sanofi\'s Lantus and Toujeo. TotalAssist lists them on the same Type 2 diabetes fund as the brand, so switching would not cost you fund eligibility. Which one is cheapest for you depends on your plan\'s formulary — ask your plan which glargine it prefers.',

      question: 'Is Lantus part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',

        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Lantus, Toujeo or insulin glargine row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028. The only insulin on any of those lists is Novo Nordisk\'s insulin aspart, sold as NovoLog and Fiasp, which was selected for 2026 — a different product from a different manufacturer, and its negotiated price does not apply to Lantus.
