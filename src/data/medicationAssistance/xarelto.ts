  // rivaroxaban — factor Xa inhibitor, i.e. an anticoagulant (Xarelto US PI).
  drugClass: ['anticoagulant'],
  description:
    'Xarelto is a once- or twice-daily oral anticoagulant (a factor Xa inhibitor) used to prevent strokes in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, to treat and prevent blood clots, and to lower cardiovascular risk in coronary and peripheral artery disease.',
  usedFor: [
    'Reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation',
    'Treating deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and reducing the risk of them recurring',
    'Preventing DVT after hip or knee replacement surgery, and preventing blood clots in acutely ill hospitalized medical patients',
    'Reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events in coronary artery disease, and major thrombotic vascular events in peripheral artery disease (2.5 mg, with aspirin)',
    'Treating and preventing blood clots in children, including after the Fontan procedure',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Brand Xarelto is usually placed on a brand tier with a copay or coinsurance every month. Two things now cut against that cost: Medicare\'s negotiated price of $197 for a 30-day supply took effect in January 2026, and FDA-approved generic rivaroxaban exists — the 2.5 mg strength since March 2025, with 10, 15 and 20 mg generics approved and at least one full-strength generic label marketed. Whether your pharmacy stocks the full-strength generic is a question for the counter, not this page.',
  medicareContext:
    'Xarelto is generally covered under Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans, sometimes with prior authorization or step therapy versus other anticoagulants. It is one of the first ten drugs with a Medicare-negotiated Maximum Fair Price: $197.00 for a 30-day supply in 2026 (versus a $517 list price in 2023, per CMS). That is the price to your plan — your copay still depends on your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, and Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes, there are real routes — but not a charitable grant right now. Johnson & Johnson\'s patient assistance program accepts Medicare patients with income at or below 300% of the poverty level, the free 30-day trial is open to Part D enrollees, and Extra Help can lower the copay. The savings card excludes Medicare. Every charity fund we checked for atrial fibrillation, blood clots, stroke or artery disease was closed or does not exist yet.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Xarelto?',
      answer:
        'Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Xarelto, and since January 1, 2026 Medicare pays a negotiated Maximum Fair Price of $197 for a 30-day supply. Your copay depends on your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, and Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can lower a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Xarelto patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Yes. The Johnson & Johnson Patient Assistance Program accepts people with Medicare and provides Xarelto at no cost for up to a year to eligible patients with household income at or below 300% of the federal poverty level — $46,950 for one person or $63,450 for two in 2026. Part D patients with income at or below 150% FPL must show they are not eligible for Extra Help. Call 833-742-0791, Monday–Friday 8am–8pm ET.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Xarelto savings card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. J&J states the XARELTO withMe Savings Card "is not for people who use any state or federal government-funded healthcare program," naming Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, Department of Defense and Veterans Administration. The 30-day Trial Offer is different: its card states Medicare Part D patients are eligible, once per lifetime, though the free supply cannot count toward your Part D out-of-pocket cap.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Xarelto right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Xarelto under its Stroke, peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease health-equity and cardiomyopathy funds — all closed — and its atrial fibrillation, DVT and PE funds are "identified need" funds still waiting for donations. HealthWell and Good Days have no fund for these diagnoses. Sign up for TotalAssist notifications and check back.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Xarelto?',
      answer:
        'Yes, with a caveat. FDA approved the first generic rivaroxaban 2.5 mg tablets in March 2025, and its Drugs@FDA database now shows approved generics for the 10, 15 and 20 mg tablets from several manufacturers, with at least one full-strength generic label on the market. Most generic labels we found still cover only the 2.5 mg strength, so ask your pharmacist whether your strength is stocked and what it costs on your plan.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the $197 Xarelto price?',
      answer:
        'It is Medicare\'s negotiated Maximum Fair Price for a 30-day supply of Xarelto in 2026, down from a $517 list price in 2023 according to CMS. It sets what Part D plans pay; your copay is set by your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, so your out-of-pocket amount may differ depending on your deductible and the annual cap.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happened to XARELTO withMe Coverage Gap Support?',
      answer:
        'J&J ended it. Its FAQ explains that with the Part D out-of-pocket cap (now $2,100 in 2026) "XARELTO withMe Coverage Gap Support will no longer be needed for most patients in the program." Medicare patients who still cannot afford Xarelto are pointed to the J&J Patient Assistance Program, Extra Help, state pharmaceutical assistance programs and Patient Advocate Foundation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if the fund is closed?',
      answer:
        'TotalAssist offers text, email or phone notifications when a fund opens, with no waitlist or queue. While you wait, the routes that do not depend on a fund balance are the J&J program, the trial offer, generic rivaroxaban, Extra Help, a formulary exception through your doctor, and a Part D plan comparison in the fall.
