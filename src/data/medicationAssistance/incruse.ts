// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Incruse Ellipta (umeclidinium) — GSK. Independently researched 2026-08-26.
// Batch 8 — a NEW slug.
//
// Incruse is the single-ingredient member of the GSK Ellipta family, and that is
// what this page is for. Anoro adds a second bronchodilator to the same molecule;
// Trelegy adds a steroid to that pair. A reader who has been prescribed one of
// the three, or moved between them, needs to know that the price, the cash
// options and the Medicare negotiation status are all different — even though
// the manufacturer program and the charitable funds are shared.
//
// The differentiating facts here:
//  • GSK sells Incruse direct for cash at $134.20 — the LOWEST published cash
//    price of any inhaler in this registry, and $88.74 less than Anoro, the
//    two-drug version of the same medicine. The federal TrumpRx site lists it at
//    $159.20, which is the same price with GSK's up-to-$25 fee folded in.
//  • An authorized generic exists: DailyMed labels "UMECLIDINIUM ELLIPTA".
//  • Incruse is NOT a Medicare-negotiated drug and is not selected for any
//    initial price applicability year — unlike Anoro (IPAY 2028), Breo (IPAY
//    2027, $67.00) and Trelegy (IPAY 2027). That negative matters precisely
//    because its siblings are on the lists.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  usedFor: [
    'Maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, to improve airflow',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Incruse Ellipta is a brand inhaler used every day indefinitely, and Part D plans generally put it on a brand tier. But it is the least expensive inhaler in this registry to buy outright: GSK sells it direct at $134.20, plus a processing and shipping fee of up to $25. For comparison, the same program prices Anoro Ellipta — Incruse plus a second bronchodilator — at $222.94. An authorized generic, "Umeclidinium Ellipta", is also labelled on DailyMed.',
  medicareContext:
    'Incruse Ellipta is an inhaler you use yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, usually on a brand tier. It is NOT a Medicare-negotiated drug: CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Incruse or umeclidinium-alone row for 2026, 2027 or 2028. That is worth stating plainly because its siblings are on those lists — Breo Ellipta and Trelegy Ellipta for 2027, Anoro Ellipta for 2028 — so it is easy to assume the whole family is covered when it is not. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan can spread what you owe across the year.',

Because the charitable side is shut, the routes that actually move money for this medication are the ones that do not depend on a fund balance: GSK\'s patient assistance program, the authorized generic, Extra Help, and the $134.20 cash price — which for Incruse is a genuinely competitive number rather than a last resort.

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Incruse Ellipta?',
      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Incruse Ellipta, usually on a brand tier. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there an Incruse Ellipta patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Incruse Ellipta is on the GSK Patient Assistance Program\'s published list of eligible products and the program has a Medicare route. The requirement people miss is the spending threshold: for GSK\'s "general" medicines, which includes Incruse, you must have "paid a total of $600 for prescriptions in the current calendar year". You also need a Medicare drug plan and income at or below $47,880 for one person in the 48 states and DC.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Incruse Ellipta part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No, and this is worth checking rather than assuming, because three of its close relatives are. CMS\'s selected-drug file has no Incruse Ellipta or umeclidinium-alone row for 2026, 2027 or 2028. Breo Ellipta and Trelegy Ellipta were selected for initial price applicability year 2027, and Anoro Ellipta for 2028 — but Incruse was not selected in any cycle. Your cost is set by your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How is Incruse Ellipta different from Anoro Ellipta?',
      answer:
        'Incruse contains one long-acting bronchodilator, umeclidinium. Anoro contains the same umeclidinium plus a second bronchodilator, vilanterol. Neither contains a steroid, and both are licensed for COPD only. The practical differences for cost are real: GSK sells Incruse direct at $134.20 and Anoro at $222.94, Anoro has been selected for Medicare price negotiation in 2028 and Incruse has not, and each has its own authorized generic. The GSK assistance program and the charitable funds treat them the same way.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I buy Incruse Ellipta with cash instead of using Medicare?',
      answer:
        'It is worth checking, and more often worth it here than for pricier inhalers. GSK sells Incruse direct at $134.20 plus a processing and shipping fee of up to $25; the federal TrumpRx site lists it at $159.20, which is the same price with the fee included. GSK\'s terms say the offer "is not available to patients who wish to use insurance", and cash spending will not count toward your Part D deductible or annual out-of-pocket cap. If your plan charges coinsurance on a brand tier, compare carefully.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Incruse Ellipta?',
      answer:
        'Yes, an authorized generic. DailyMed lists five labelled umeclidinium products across two labelers, including "Umeclidinium Ellipta" alongside GSK\'s Incruse Ellipta. Whether it lowers your copay depends on your plan\'s formulary, so ask your prescriber and plan directly. See <a href="/prescription-drug-assistance.html">all prescription assistance options</a>.',
