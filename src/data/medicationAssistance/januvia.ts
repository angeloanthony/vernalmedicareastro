// Januvia (sitagliptin) — Merck. Independently researched 2026-08-26. Every
// program below was read on the official source cited with it. Batch 7 — a NEW
// slug, selected for information value rather than for demand.
//
// The finding that makes this page worth having: the Merck Patient Assistance
// Program is the first manufacturer program in this registry that names MEDICARE
// AS DISQUALIFYING COVERAGE. AZ&Me accepts Medicare beneficiaries who are not
// eligible for Extra Help; Lilly Cares has a Medicare group; Pfizer's program
// explicitly serves people "who are uninsured or have government-issued
// insurance". Merck's does not: its first eligibility condition is that you "do
// not have insurance or other coverage for your prescription medicine", and it
// lists Medicare among the examples. There is a documented hardship exception,
// and that exception is the whole Medicare story here — so it is quoted rather
// than paraphrased away.
//
// Second thing worth knowing: Januvia already HAS a Medicare-negotiated price.
// $113.00 for a 30-day equivalent supply took effect 2026-01-01, and the
// inflation-adjusted figure of $116.06 applies from 2027-01-01. Most records in
// this registry describe a negotiated price that has not started yet.
//
// Research gap carried honestly: januvia.com now serves the prescribing
// information PDF rather than a consumer site, and no Merck-owned savings-card
// page could be found. Third-party directories report a $5 card; that is not an
// official source, so the savings card is `verify` and no dollar figure is
// published here.

  description:
    'Januvia is a once-daily tablet for type 2 diabetes. It blocks an enzyme called DPP-4 so the body\'s own blood-sugar-lowering hormones keep working longer after a meal. It is not insulin and it is not a GLP-1 injection — it is an oral medicine taken with diet and exercise.',
  usedFor: [
    'As an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus',
    'Not for patients with type 1 diabetes',
    'Not studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Januvia is a long-established brand that Part D plans have generally placed on a brand tier, so a deductible or a non-preferred tier can make early-year fills expensive. Two things now pull the other way, and both are specific to this medication. Generic sitagliptin is labelled with FDA and sits on the same charitable-fund lists as the brand. And Medicare has negotiated Januvia\'s price: $113.00 for a 30-day equivalent supply took effect on January 1, 2026, with $116.06 applying from January 1, 2027. What you pay is still your plan\'s cost-sharing, but it is cost-sharing calculated against a negotiated price rather than a list price.',
  medicareContext:
    'Januvia is a tablet you take yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan. It is one of the first ten drugs CMS negotiated: the maximum fair price is $113.00 per 30-day equivalent supply from January 1, 2026, adjusted to $116.06 from January 1, 2027, and the combination products Janumet and Janumet XR were negotiated separately at $80.00 from January 1, 2027. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources. The manufacturer route is the one to read carefully here: Merck\'s assistance program is built for people without insurance, and having Medicare is listed as coverage that disqualifies you unless a hardship exception is granted.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Partly — and the manufacturer program works differently from the ones on our other diabetes pages. Merck gives Januvia away free, but its eligibility rules are written for people with no insurance and name Medicare as disqualifying coverage. A Medicare beneficiary\'s route in is Merck\'s documented financial-and-medical-hardship exception. Meanwhile Medicare has already negotiated Januvia\'s price, generic sitagliptin exists, and both diabetes charity funds were closed.',
    points: [
      'Merck Patient Assistance Program: provides Januvia free, but you must "not have insurance or other coverage for your prescription medicine" — Merck lists Medicare among the disqualifying examples. Income limits $63,840 (individual), $86,560 (couple), $132,000 (family of four).',
      'The exception that matters on Medicare: Merck states that people who do not meet the insurance criteria "may still qualify… if they attest that they have special circumstances of financial and medical hardship, and their income meets the program criteria."',
      'Medicare negotiated price: $113.00 per 30-day equivalent supply from January 1, 2026; $116.06 from January 1, 2027. This is already in effect, unlike most negotiated prices described on this site.',
      'Generic sitagliptin is labelled with FDA and appears on the same charitable-fund lists as the brand — usually the largest saving with no application attached.',

      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans cover Januvia, and it is one of the drugs whose price Medicare has negotiated. The maximum fair price is $113.00 for a 30-day equivalent supply from January 1, 2026, rising to $116.06 from January 1, 2027. You still pay your plan\'s cost-sharing, but it is calculated against that price. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Januvia patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Merck runs one, but its rules are unusual and worth reading closely. The Merck Patient Assistance Program provides Januvia free — and its eligibility requires that you "do not have insurance or other coverage for your prescription medicine", with Medicare listed among the examples of disqualifying coverage. Merck does publish an exception: people who do not meet the insurance criteria "may still qualify… if they attest that they have special circumstances of financial and medical hardship, and their income meets the program criteria." If you have Part D, that exception is your route. Call 1-800-727-5400.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the Merck income limits?',
      answer:
        'Merck publishes $63,840 or less for an individual, $86,560 or less for a couple, and $132,000 or less for a family of four, with different limits in Alaska and Hawaii (call 1-800-727-5400 for those). These figures belong to Merck\'s own table. Other manufacturers publish different dollar limits even when they describe eligibility in similar terms, because each builds its table from a poverty-guideline year of its own choosing — never carry one program\'s numbers to another\'s application.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Januvia right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist\'s Type 2 diabetes fund lists Januvia and generic sitagliptin but was closed to new applicants, and HealthWell\'s Type 2 Diabetes fund was closed too. Good Days has no diabetes fund. Sign up for alerts on both; TotalAssist has no waitlist, so the notification is what gets you in.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Januvia?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Generic sitagliptin tablets are labelled with FDA alongside Merck\'s Januvia, and TotalAssist lists generic sitagliptin on the same fund as the brand. There are also separately branded sitagliptin products (Zituvio, Brynovin) and generic sitagliptin-metformin combinations. Ask your prescriber and your plan what the generic costs on your formulary — for many people that is the largest saving available, and it needs no application.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use a Januvia savings card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Manufacturer copay cards cannot be used with Part D, Medicare Advantage drug coverage, Medicaid, TRICARE or VA benefits — federal anti-kickback rules are why. We could not verify the current Januvia card at all: januvia.com now serves the prescribing-information PDF rather than a consumer site, and no Merck-owned savings page could be found, so no terms or dollar figures are published here.',

    {
      question: 'What happens if the fund is closed?',
      answer:
        'TotalAssist offers text, email or automated-call notifications when a fund opens, with no waitlist or queue; HealthWell offers alerts on each fund page. While you wait, the routes that do not depend on a fund balance are the generic, the negotiated price, Extra Help, Merck\'s hardship exception, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan.
