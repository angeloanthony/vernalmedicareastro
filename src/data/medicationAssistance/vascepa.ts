// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Vascepa (icosapent ethyl) — Amarin Pharma. Independently researched
// 2026-08-26. Batch 8 — a NEW slug, and the last of the 22.
//
// Vascepa is the only medication in this expansion that appears on TWO
// TotalAssist funds with materially different awards where ONE OF THEM IS OPEN:
//
//   Hypercholesterolemia   OPEN     $1,900 guaranteed / $3,800 maximum
//   Hypertriglyceridemia   Closed   $3,300 guaranteed / $6,600 maximum
//
// The closed fund pays nearly twice as much, and Vascepa's own label carries both
// a cardiovascular-risk indication (in people with elevated triglycerides) and a
// severe-hypertriglyceridemia indication. So which fund a reader should apply to
// — and which they should set an alert on — genuinely depends on their diagnosis
// and on whether they can wait. That is a real, actionable decision, and it is
// the spine of this page.
//
// Second finding: icosapent ethyl is thoroughly generic — 31 labelled products
// across 21 labelers — and the federal TrumpRx site prices the generic at $14.00
// while carrying no brand listing at all. Amarin offers a Medicare beneficiary
// nothing: its savings program excludes Medicare by name and it publishes no
// income-tested patient assistance program.
//
// TAXONOMY: introduces `omega-3`. The label describes Vascepa as "a
// lipid-regulating agent" containing "icosapent ethyl, an omega-3 fatty acid
// ethyl ester". Neither 'acl-inhibitor' nor 'pcsk9' can carry it, and its primary
// target is triglycerides rather than LDL.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Vascepa is a purified omega-3 capsule — icosapent ethyl — taken alongside a statin to reduce cardiovascular risk in people with raised triglycerides, and separately to lower very high triglyceride levels. It is not the same thing as an over-the-counter fish-oil supplement, and for assistance purposes the important thing is which of its two indications you were prescribed it for, because the two lead to charitable funds paying very different amounts.',
  usedFor: [
    'Reducing the risk of heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularisation and unstable angina requiring hospitalisation in adults on maximally tolerated statin therapy who have triglycerides at or above 150 mg/dL and either established cardiovascular disease or diabetes with two or more additional cardiovascular risk factors',
    'Reducing triglyceride levels in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia — triglycerides at or above 500 mg/dL',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Brand Vascepa sits on a brand tier and is taken four capsules a day, so quantities are large. But the cost picture has changed substantially: icosapent ethyl is now thoroughly generic, with 31 labelled products from 21 different labelers on DailyMed, and the federal TrumpRx site prices generic icosapent ethyl at $14.00 while carrying no listing for the brand. Amarin, meanwhile, offers a Medicare beneficiary nothing — its savings program excludes Medicare by name and it publishes no income-tested assistance program.',
  medicareContext:
    'Vascepa is a capsule you take yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, with brand Vascepa on a brand tier and generic icosapent ethyl typically on a much lower generic tier. It is not a Medicare-negotiated drug: CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Vascepa or icosapent ethyl row for 2026, 2027 or 2028 — unsurprising for a medicine that already has generic competition. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan can spread what you owe across the year. One practical Medicare note: because Vascepa\'s cardiovascular indication requires you to be on maximally tolerated statin therapy, a plan reviewing a prior authorisation may want evidence of that, so have your statin history to hand.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes — and Vascepa is the rare case with a charitable fund that was actually open. TotalAssist\'s Hypercholesterolemia fund was accepting applications, lists Vascepa by name, and pays $1,900 guaranteed up to $3,800. Its Hypertriglyceridemia fund pays nearly double but was closed. Amarin itself offers a Medicare beneficiary nothing, and generic icosapent ethyl costs $14.00 on the federal cash-price site.',

  charitableSummary:
    'Vascepa has the most interesting charitable picture in this expansion, and it repays a couple of minutes\' thought. TotalAssist covers it on two funds because its label carries two indications. The Hypercholesterolemia fund was OPEN on August 26, 2026, paying $1,900 guaranteed up to $3,800. The Hypertriglyceridemia fund was closed but pays $3,300 guaranteed up to $6,600 — nearly double, for the same medication. Both list Vascepa and the generic icosapent ethyl by name. So the sensible move for most readers is to apply to the open fund now if your diagnosis fits it, and simultaneously set an alert on the HTG fund, which is the larger prize if severe hypertriglyceridemia is your diagnosis. Note that TotalAssist gives one grant per condition, so this is about which fund matches your diagnosis rather than collecting both. HealthWell\'s hypercholesterolemia fund was closed and it runs no HTG fund at all; Good Days has nothing. Since Amarin offers a Medicare beneficiary no manufacturer route whatsoever, these funds plus the generic are the whole picture.',
  extraHelpNote:
    'Extra Help carries full weight here because there is no manufacturer program to weigh it against. There is no conflict to manage and nothing to choose between: if your income and resources are limited, apply. With full Extra Help a covered brand-name drug costs about $12.65 in 2026, and a generic costs less still — which for icosapent ethyl, already priced at $14.00 as a generic on the federal cash-price site, is a small saving stacked onto a small one. Extra Help and the TotalAssist funds can be held together, since the funds require government insurance rather than excluding subsidy holders.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Vascepa?',
      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover it, with brand Vascepa on a brand tier and generic icosapent ethyl typically on a much lower generic tier. Prior authorisation is common, and because the cardiovascular indication requires maximally tolerated statin therapy, a plan may ask for your statin history. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Which charity fund should I apply to for Vascepa?',
      answer:
        'It depends on your diagnosis, and the difference is substantial. TotalAssist covers Vascepa on two funds because its label has two indications. The Hypercholesterolemia fund was OPEN when we checked on August 26, 2026, paying $1,900 guaranteed up to $3,800. The Hypertriglyceridemia fund was closed but pays $3,300 guaranteed up to $6,600 — nearly double. If your recorded diagnosis is severe hypertriglyceridemia, that is the fund built for you and the one to set an alert on; if it is hypercholesterolemia, apply to the open fund now. TotalAssist gives one grant per condition, so this is about matching your diagnosis rather than collecting both.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Vascepa patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Amarin\'s published support for Vascepa is a savings card for commercially insured patients and, for uninsured patients, a GoodRx discount arrangement — and no income-based program that supplies Vascepa free of charge. The savings card excludes Medicare outright: "Patients enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, or similar federal or state prescription drug insurance programs are not eligible for this offer." So Amarin offers a Medicare beneficiary nothing, which is why the open TotalAssist fund and the generic carry this page.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Vascepa?',
      answer:
        'Yes, and it is thoroughly established. DailyMed lists 31 labelled icosapent ethyl products across 21 distinct labelers, including Amneal, Apotex, Aurobindo, Camber and Dr. Reddy\'s. The federal TrumpRx site prices generic icosapent ethyl at $14.00 and carries no listing for brand Vascepa. Both TotalAssist funds list the generic alongside the brand, so switching would not cost you fund eligibility.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Vascepa the same as fish oil from the pharmacy shelf?',
      answer:
        'No, and it is worth being clear about, because the price difference makes the substitution tempting. Vascepa is a prescription medicine — the label describes it as "a lipid-regulating agent" containing "icosapent ethyl, an omega-3 fatty acid ethyl ester" — approved with specific indications and specific triglyceride thresholds behind them. Over-the-counter fish-oil supplements are not equivalent products and are not regulated the same way. If cost is the problem, generic icosapent ethyl at $14.00 is the substitution to ask your prescriber about, not a supplement.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Vascepa part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Vascepa or icosapent ethyl row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028 — unsurprising for a medicine that already has generic competition, since the program selects drugs without it. Your cost is set by your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, and above all by whether you are dispensed the brand or the generic.
