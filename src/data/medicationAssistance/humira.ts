// Humira (adalimumab) — AbbVie. Independently researched 2026-08-26. Every
// program below was read on the official source cited with it. Batch 3
// (spec §24 #12) — a NEW page.
//
// THE FINDING THAT DEFINES THIS PAGE: AbbVie has closed myAbbVie Assist to new
// HUMIRA patients. The official program update reads, verbatim: "Effective
// July 1, 2026, myAbbVie Assist PAP will no longer accept new patients for
// HUMIRA into the program." This is exactly the trap the project's evidence
// rule exists to catch — AbbVie HAS a patient assistance program, and Skyrizi
// and Rinvoq are still in it, so "AbbVie has a PAP" would have produced a
// wrong page. The drug-specific source is what settles it.
//
// RESEARCH NOTE (access): www.abbvie.com serves a Cloudflare block page; the
// apex host abbvie.com serves the same pages. Every AbbVie fact here was read
// on the official page or on AbbVie's own application PDFs under
// abbvie.com/content/dam/, not on a search summary.
//
// A live trap for readers: AbbVie's "online application overview" page still
// links a HUMIRA application PDF (H-APP1-24L-1, December 2024). A downloadable
// form is not an open program — the program update governs.

  // "HUMIRA is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker" (label) — a biologic.
  drugClass: ['biologic'],
  description:
    'Humira is an injected TNF blocker used for a long list of immune-driven conditions, from rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis to Crohn\'s disease and ulcerative colitis. It has been on the U.S. market since 2002, and since 2023 a growing set of FDA-approved adalimumab biosimilars has been available alongside it — which is the single most important fact for anyone facing a Humira bill in 2026.',
  usedFor: [
    'Moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in adults, and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients 2 and older',
    'Active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis in adults',
    'Moderately to severely active Crohn\'s disease (adults and patients 6 and older) and ulcerative colitis (adults and patients 5 and older)',
    'Moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy',
    'Moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in patients 12 and older',
    'Non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adults and patients 2 and older',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Humira sits on the specialty tier of most Part D formularies, where you pay a percentage of a very high price rather than a flat copay. Nothing about that has changed — but the market around it has: AbbVie itself now points patients toward FDA-approved adalimumab biosimilars, and has begun withdrawing brand Humira from its own patient assistance program because of them.',
  medicareContext:
    'Humira is generally covered under Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans, usually on a specialty tier and often with prior authorization or step therapy. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan lets you spread that cap across monthly payments — for a specialty drug like this, that matters, because the cap is often reached in the first months of the year. Humira is not on the Medicare-negotiated drug lists for 2026 or 2027. Ask your plan how it covers adalimumab biosimilars: for many plans in 2026 a biosimilar sits on a lower tier than brand Humira.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'The manufacturer route has closed. AbbVie stopped accepting new HUMIRA patients into myAbbVie Assist on July 1, 2026 and is phasing the brand out of the program, pointing patients to adalimumab biosimilars instead. The savings card excludes Medicare. Every autoimmune and bowel-disease charity fund we checked was closed to new applicants.

Because specialty tiers charge a percentage rather than a flat copay, many people reach the $2,100 Part D out-of-pocket cap early in the year. Ask your plan how it covers adalimumab biosimilars too — on many 2026 plans a biosimilar sits on a lower tier than brand Humira. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can lower a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',

      question: 'Can I still get Humira through AbbVie\'s patient assistance program?',
      answer:
        'Not as a new patient. AbbVie\'s official program update states: "Effective July 1, 2026, myAbbVie Assist PAP will no longer accept new patients for HUMIRA into the program." AbbVie says it will continue to support currently enrolled patients through the end of their current eligibility term, and that when that term ends those patients will not be able to renew for Humira. The program itself is still running for other AbbVie medicines, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq.',
    },
    {
      question: 'AbbVie\'s website still has a Humira patient assistance application. Can I send it in?',
      answer:
        'A form being downloadable is not the same as a program being open. AbbVie\'s application-overview page still links a HUMIRA application dated December 2024, while the program update page says new HUMIRA patients are not accepted as of July 1, 2026. Before spending time on paperwork, call AbbVie Patient Access Support at 1-800-222-6885, Monday–Friday 7am–7pm Central, and ask directly.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why did AbbVie remove Humira from its assistance program?',
      answer:
        'AbbVie gives its reason on the program update page: "After carefully reviewing the growing number of treatment options available to patients today, including FDA-approved adalimumab biosimilars that may be available through insurance or other support programs, we have decided to begin phasing out HUMIRA from the myAbbVie Assist Patient Assistance Program." AbbVie adds that if you are doing well on Humira, a biosimilar may be an option, and that many biosimilars have their own patient assistance programs.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the HUMIRA Complete Savings Card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. AbbVie\'s terms state the copay assistance program is not available to patients receiving reimbursement under any federal, state or government-funded insurance program, and name Medicare including Part D, Medicare Advantage, Medigap, Medicaid, TRICARE, DoD and VA. Federal anti-kickback rules are the reason — see the key terms lower on this page.',

    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Humira right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Humira under seven funds — rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease and uveitis — and HealthWell lists it on its AutoImmune and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Medicare Access funds. All nine were closed to new applicants. Sign up for alerts at both foundations and check back; funds reopen when money arrives.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Humira?',
      answer:
        'There is no generic, but there are FDA-approved adalimumab biosimilars — highly similar versions from other manufacturers, several of which are marketed in the United States. AbbVie now points Humira patients toward them directly. Ask your plan or pharmacist which adalimumab biosimilar your formulary prefers and what tier it sits on, then ask your prescriber whether switching is right for you.
