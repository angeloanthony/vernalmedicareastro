// Ofev (nintedanib) — Boehringer Ingelheim. Independently researched
// 2026-08-26. Batch 6 (spec §24 Phase 4 list, the closing four) — a NEW slug.
//
// THE TAXONOMY TEST. Ofev was the medication the project reserved to decide
// whether the `respiratory` condition key could carry pulmonary fibrosis, or
// whether a `lung-disease` key had to exist (project §31 #6). It was decided on
// evidence, and the evidence said the existing key could not do the job:
//
//   • The label carries no asthma or COPD indication at all — IPF, chronic
//     fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype, and SSc-ILD.
//   • The funds are different funds. On the checked date TotalAssist's
//     Pulmonary fibrosis fund was OPEN ($3,500 / $7,000) and lists Ofev, while
//     its COPD and Asthma funds were CLOSED ($1,200 / $3,500) and do not list
//     Ofev. HealthWell splits the same way: Pulmonary Fibrosis and Systemic
//     Sclerosis with ILD at $9,000, both listing Ofev, versus COPD at $3,250
//     and Asthma at $4,500, neither listing it.
//
// Because `conditions` is what programsForDrug() matches disease funds on,
// tagging Ofev `respiratory` would have pointed a fibrosis patient at inhaler
// funds that are closed, smaller, and do not cover their medicine. The key was
// added; the full reasoning lives with it in data/conditions.ts. No inhaler
// moved, and `respiratory` is unchanged.
//
// RESEARCH LIMIT (same as Spiriva): every Boehringer Ingelheim patient-facing
// host refused automated access on 2026-08-26. Only docs.boehringer-ingelheim.com
// could be read, and the Ofev savings-card terms it serves expired on
// 12/31/2024. The two Boehringer Ingelheim programs below are therefore
// `verify`, with the reason stated on each card.

  description:
    'Ofev is a twice-daily capsule for scarring lung diseases. Nintedanib blocks several signalling enzymes involved in fibrosis, which slows the rate at which lung function declines. It is not an inhaler and does not open the airways — it is a different kind of medicine for a different kind of lung disease from COPD or asthma, and that distinction runs through every assistance program on this page.',
  usedFor: [
    'Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in adults',
    'Treatment of chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with a progressive phenotype in adults',
    'Slowing the rate of decline in pulmonary function in adults with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD)',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Ofev is a specialty capsule taken twice a day indefinitely, and Medicare\'s own negotiation puts a number on the scale: CMS set a maximum fair price of $6,350.00 for a 30-day equivalent supply, effective January 1, 2027 — the negotiated price, which means the price before negotiation was higher still. On a Part D specialty tier the coinsurance on a drug at that level reaches the annual out-of-pocket cap quickly, usually in the first months of the year. The manufacturer savings card excludes Medicare, so a Part D beneficiary carries plan cost-sharing until the cap. The one thing that has changed the arithmetic recently is that generic nintedanib is now on the market — eleven capsule labels besides Boehringer Ingelheim\'s own.',
  medicareContext:
    'Ofev is a capsule you take yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, generally on a specialty tier with prior authorization. It is one of the 15 drugs CMS selected for the second cycle of Medicare drug price negotiation: the maximum fair price for Ofev is $6,350.00 per 30-day equivalent supply, and it takes effect on January 1, 2027 for people whose Part D plans cover it. Until then, and after, the Part D out-of-pocket cap applies — $2,100 in 2026 — and Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources. A negotiated price is not a cash price: it changes what plans and enrollees pay, not what a pharmacy charges someone paying out of pocket.',

HealthWell\'s Pulmonary Fibrosis and Systemic Sclerosis with ILD funds also list Ofev, with a $9,000 maximum award each, and both were closed — worth alerts, because that is the largest grant in this registry. One thing to be careful about: the COPD and asthma funds are not your funds. They are separate funds with less money, they were closed, and they do not list Ofev.

Call 1-800-556-8317 and ask directly. Meanwhile, the route we could confirm is open is the TotalAssist Pulmonary fibrosis fund.',

        'Yes, as of August 26, 2026. TotalAssist\'s Pulmonary fibrosis fund was open, lists "Ofev (Nintedanib Esylate)" on its approved-medication list, and pays a $3,500 guaranteed award up to a $7,000 maximum for people with government insurance and income at or below 500% of the federal poverty level adjusted for local cost of living.

      question: 'I have a lung disease — can I use a COPD assistance fund for Ofev?',
      answer:
        'No, and this is the most common wrong turn with this medication. Charitable funds match your diagnosis, not the organ. TotalAssist and HealthWell each run pulmonary fibrosis funds that are separate from their COPD and asthma funds, with different money and different medication lists: on August 26, 2026 the COPD fund was closed, paid less, and did not list Ofev at all, while the pulmonary fibrosis fund was open and did. Apply to the fund that names your diagnosis.',

    {
      question: 'Can I use the Ofev savings card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Boehringer Ingelheim\'s terms make the offer "only valid for commercially insured patients" and not valid where a prescription is "eligible to be reimbursed, in whole or in part, by any federal healthcare programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, Medigap, the Retiree Drug Subsidy Program, VA, DOD, TRICARE." Federal anti-kickback rules are why every manufacturer copay card works this way.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Ofev?',
      answer:
        'Yes. A DailyMed search for nintedanib returns eleven capsule label entries besides Boehringer Ingelheim\'s Ofev. TotalAssist states that its funds cover the prescription medications for a diagnosis including generic or bioequivalent drugs, so a generic does not put you outside the grant. Ask your prescriber and your plan what generic nintedanib costs on your formulary.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is Ofev\'s Medicare negotiated price?',
      answer:
        'CMS selected Ofev for the second cycle of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program and published a maximum fair price of $6,350.00 for a 30-day equivalent supply, effective January 1, 2027. A negotiated price lowers what Part D plans and their enrollees pay for the drug; it is not a pharmacy cash price, and it does not replace your plan\'s cost-sharing rules. See <a href="/prescription-drug-assistance.html">all prescription assistance options</a> for what applies before then.',
