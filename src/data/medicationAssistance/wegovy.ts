// researched 2026-08-26. Every program below was read on the official source
// cited with it. Batch 5 (spec §24 Phase 4 list) — a NEW slug.
//
// Wegovy has three Medicare routes and CMS's own prior-authorization form says
// they are mutually exclusive: weight management with no Part D-eligible
// diagnosis → the Medicare GLP-1 Bridge ($50 a month, outside Part D);
// cardiovascular risk reduction → regular Part D; MASH (injection only) →
// regular Part D. The negotiated price that arrives in 2027 applies only where
// Part D covers the drug — and the headline $274 is a blended figure for the
// "Ozempic; Rybelsus; Wegovy" entry, not a Wegovy price (CMS's Wegovy example
// is $385.63 per 4-pen package). GLP-1 record: HIGHER MAINTENANCE RISK (§5C).

  description:
    'Wegovy is the weight-management and cardiovascular brand of semaglutide — the same molecule as Ozempic — sold as a weekly injection and, since 2025, as a daily tablet. How Medicare treats it depends entirely on why it was prescribed: weight management goes through the $50-a-month Medicare GLP-1 Bridge, while heart-disease risk reduction and MASH go through regular Part D.',
  usedFor: [
    'Reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack or non-fatal stroke) in adults with established cardiovascular disease and either obesity or overweight — injection and tablets',
    'Reducing excess body weight and maintaining weight reduction long term in adults with obesity, or adults with overweight and at least one weight-related condition, with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity — injection and tablets (the injection also in children 12 and older with obesity)',
    'Treating noncirrhotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis in adults — injection only, under accelerated approval',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Novo Nordisk publishes a list price of $1,349.02 per package for Wegovy. When it is prescribed for weight management alone, Part D does not cover it, so without the Bridge or a cash price you face the full amount and nothing you pay counts toward the $2,100 Part D cap. When it is covered — for cardiovascular risk reduction or MASH — plans place it on a high tier with prior authorization. Novo\'s patient assistance program does not list Wegovy and the savings offer excludes government beneficiaries.',
  medicareContext:
    'CMS\'s own Bridge prior-authorization form draws the line: if Wegovy is prescribed to reduce cardiovascular risk in an adult with established heart disease, or for MASH, the request "must" go to the Part D plan — those are Part D-eligible uses, covered under your plan\'s rules and counting toward your deductible and cap. If it is prescribed to reduce weight with no Part D-eligible diagnosis, the route is the Medicare GLP-1 Bridge: all strengths of the Wegovy pen and pill for $50 a month, July 1, 2026 through December 31, 2027, outside Part D. Semaglutide ("Ozempic; Rybelsus; Wegovy") has a negotiated Medicare price effective January 1, 2027 — $274 for a blended 30-day supply, and $385.63 per package of four 2.4 mg Wegovy pens in CMS\'s example — which applies only when Part D covers the drug. Novo has separately said it will cut Wegovy\'s list price to $675 on the same date. CMS says its BALANCE Model is not launching in Medicare in 2027.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Usually yes — but which door depends on the diagnosis. For weight management, Part D enrollees who meet the Bridge criteria get the Wegovy pen or pill for $50 a month through the Medicare GLP-1 Bridge, with no application. For heart-disease risk reduction or MASH, Wegovy is a regular Part D drug and Extra Help applies. The manufacturer patient assistance program does not cover Wegovy and the savings offer excludes Medicare; Novo\'s self-pay prices ($149–$399 a month) are open to Medicare enrollees who pay outside their plan. The obesity charity fund was closed; the MASH funds at TotalAssist and HealthWell were open.',

      'Regular Part D: Wegovy for cardiovascular risk reduction (established heart disease plus obesity or overweight) or MASH is a Part D benefit — Novo says it "is covered through normal Medicare Part D benefits" for those uses; a negotiated price applies from January 1, 2027.',
      'Manufacturer patient assistance: Wegovy is not on Novo Nordisk\'s 2026 PAP product list. Wegovy Savings Offer: "Government beneficiaries excluded."',

Novo: "Government-insured patients may use this program if they self pay and process outside of their insurance."',

For weight management, Part D does not cover it — instead the Medicare GLP-1 Bridge supplies the Wegovy pen or pill for $50 a month from July 1, 2026 to December 31, 2027 for Part D enrollees who meet its criteria. For reducing cardiovascular risk in adults with established heart disease and obesity or overweight, and for MASH, Novo says Wegovy "is covered through normal Medicare Part D benefits," so your plan\'s tier, prior authorization and the $2,100 cap apply.

    },
    {
      question: 'How do I get Wegovy for $50 a month on Medicare?',
      answer:

You need an eligible Part D plan and to have met the BMI criteria when you started GLP-1 therapy — BMI 35 or higher; BMI 30 or higher with diastolic heart failure, uncontrolled high blood pressure or chronic kidney disease stage 3a+; or BMI 27 or higher with prediabetes, a prior heart attack or stroke, or symptomatic peripheral artery disease — and to be taking it for weight management rather than a Part D-eligible diagnosis. There is no form for you: the pharmacy submits the claim, your prescriber completes the prior authorization, and Medicare mails you a letter. Both the pen and the pill qualify at every strength. Questions: 1-800-MEDICARE.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Does Extra Help lower the $50 Bridge copay?',
      answer:
        'No. Medicare.gov says the Bridge copayment "Can\'t be lowered by programs like Extra Help," and CMS says there is no low-income subsidy on it. It also does not count toward your Part D deductible or the $2,100 cap and cannot be spread out with the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan. <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Extra Help</a> does apply when Wegovy is covered by your plan for cardiovascular risk reduction or MASH.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Wegovy patient assistance program?',
      answer:
        'Not from the manufacturer. Wegovy is not on Novo Nordisk\'s 2026 Patient Assistance Program product list (checked August 26, 2026) and never has been. The charity fund that matches a weight-management prescription — TotalAssist\'s Obesity fund — was closed to new applicants.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Wegovy savings offer with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No — Novo\'s terms say "Government beneficiaries excluded," and anyone with both commercial and government coverage counts as government-insured. What Novo does allow is the self-pay price: "Government-insured patients may use this program if they self pay and process outside of their insurance," with nothing counted toward Part D TrOOP.',

    {
      question: 'What does Wegovy cost self-pay on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'On August 26, 2026: the pen was $199 a month for the first two fills of 0.25 mg or 0.5 mg for new patients (through December 31, 2026), then $349 a month for 0.25–2.4 mg and $399 for Wegovy HD 7.2 mg; the pill was $149 a month for 1.5 mg and for 4 mg (through August 31, 2026, then $199) and $299 for 9 mg and 25 mg — through NovoCare Pharmacy or a local pharmacy, and listed identically on TrumpRx. A Medicare enrollee may buy at these prices outside their plan; the cost never counts toward the $2,100 cap.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What will Wegovy cost under the Medicare negotiated price in 2027?',
      answer:
        'CMS negotiated one price for the "Ozempic; Rybelsus; Wegovy" entry: $274 for a blended 30-day supply from January 1, 2027, against a $959 list price in 2024. CMS\'s Wegovy-specific example is $385.63 per package of four 2.4 mg pens. That price applies only where Part D covers the drug — cardiovascular risk reduction or MASH — and what you pay is your plan\'s cost-sharing on it, up to the cap. For weight management the Bridge\'s $50 is what you pay. Novo has separately said it will lower Wegovy\'s list price to $675 on the same date.',
