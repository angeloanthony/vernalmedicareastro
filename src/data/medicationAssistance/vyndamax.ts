// Vyndamax (tafamidis) — Pfizer. Independently researched 2026-08-26. Every
// program below was read on the official source cited with it. Batch 7 — a NEW
// slug, selected for information value rather than for demand.
//
// This is the first record in the registry where the honest answer is "two
// charitable funds are open right now" — TotalAssist Amyloidosis and HealthWell
// Amyloidosis were both accepting applications on the checked date. It is also
// the first record where the funds are not merely an alternative to the
// manufacturer program but a PREREQUISITE for it: Pfizer's own VYNDAMAX support
// site states that patients "are required to apply for and provide proof of
// denial prior to being considered for enrollment in the Pfizer Patient
// Assistance Program". Those two facts have to be read together, and the page
// is ordered accordingly — funds first, PAP second.
//
// Taxonomy note: `heart` is the condition key, and no amyloidosis key was
// added. The Ofev test from Batch 6 was applied and came out the other way —
// the label's indication IS a cardiomyopathy ("the cardiomyopathy of wild-type
// or hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis… to reduce cardiovascular
// mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalization"), so `heart` is true
// rather than merely adjacent. Ofev needed `lung-disease` because `respiratory`
// was flatly wrong for it; nothing here is wrong. The amyloidosis-specific
// funds live in this record's own program cards, which is what the record body
// is for. D9 holds: a key is added on a demonstrated defect, not on a theme.

  description:
    'Vyndamax is a once-daily capsule for a specific kind of heart disease: transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, in which a blood protein misfolds and deposits in the heart muscle, stiffening it. Tafamidis holds that protein in its correct shape so less of it builds up. It treats the heart condition caused by amyloidosis, which is why the charitable funds that pay for it are amyloidosis funds rather than heart-failure funds.',
  usedFor: [
    'Treatment of the cardiomyopathy of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) in adults',
    'To reduce cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalization',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Vyndamax is a brand-only specialty capsule with no generic — a DailyMed search for tafamidis returns exactly one labelled product, the combined Vyndaqel/Vyndamax label. It is taken every day indefinitely, so on a Part D specialty tier the coinsurance typically reaches the annual out-of-pocket cap early in the year. The manufacturer copay card excludes Medicare outright, and the manufacturer assistance program will not even consider a Medicare applicant until they have applied to independent foundations and been denied — which is why the charitable funds matter more here than on almost any other page on this site.',
  medicareContext:
    'Vyndamax is a capsule you take yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, generally on a specialty tier with prior authorization. It has not been selected for Medicare price negotiation — no Vyndamax, Vyndaqel or tafamidis row appears in CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file for 2026, 2027 or 2028. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026 and Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources. Note the ordering that Pfizer itself imposes: for a Medicare beneficiary the charitable funds come first, because proof that you applied to them and were denied is a condition of the Pfizer program.',

    'Two funds were open on August 26, 2026 — the only medication on this site where that was true. TotalAssist\'s Amyloidosis fund pays a $2,500 guaranteed award up to $5,500, and HealthWell\'s Amyloidosis fund pays up to $8,000, the largest award of any fund in this registry. Both list Vyndamax and Vyndaqel by name, and both require government or other qualifying insurance plus household income at or below 500% of the federal poverty level on their own tables. Good Days has no amyloidosis fund. Apply to both foundations before you approach Pfizer: the manufacturer program will not consider a Medicare applicant without proof that independent foundations turned them down, so these applications are the first step on that route as well as a route in themselves. Fund balances change without notice — check each fund page before you rely on it.',

    'Extra Help matters here for the same reason it matters on any specialty tier: with full Extra Help a covered brand-name drug costs about $12.65 in 2026 instead of specialty coinsurance.

      answer:
        'Yes. Vyndamax is a capsule you take yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan — generally on a specialty tier and usually with prior authorization. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, which on a drug at this price level is typically reached early in the year. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Vyndamax patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Yes, with a condition attached. Pfizer\'s own VYNDAMAX support site says the Pfizer Patient Assistance Program through VyndaLink "may be able to help eligible patients who are uninsured or have government-issued insurance and other financial assistance options aren\'t available" — and that patients "are required to apply for and provide proof of denial prior to being considered for enrollment." So a Medicare beneficiary is eligible in principle, but must apply to the independent amyloidosis funds first and keep the outcome letters. Call VynAssist on 1-888-863-1177.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Vyndamax right now?',
      answer:
        'Yes — two, as of August 26, 2026, which is unusual. TotalAssist\'s Amyloidosis fund was open with a $2,500 guaranteed award up to $5,500, and HealthWell\'s Amyloidosis fund was open with up to $8,000. Both name Vyndamax and Vyndaqel on their covered lists, and both require income at or below 500% of the federal poverty level on their own tables. Good Days has no amyloidosis fund. Apply to both — they hold separate money, and a denial from either counts toward Pfizer\'s proof-of-denial requirement.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Vyndamax co-pay card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Pfizer\'s terms state patients are not eligible if they are "enrolled in a state or federally funded insurance program, including but not limited to Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, Veterans Affairs health care, a state prescription drug assistance program, or the Government Health Insurance Plan available in Puerto Rico." That exclusion is standard across manufacturer copay cards and comes from federal anti-kickback rules.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Vyndamax?',
      answer:
        'No. A DailyMed search for tafamidis returns exactly one labelled product — the combined Vyndaqel and Vyndamax label from Pfizer. There is no generic tafamidis, and no cash-price route: Vyndamax is not listed on TrumpRx either. That is why the funds and the manufacturer program carry the whole weight on this page.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between Vyndamax and Vyndaqel?',
      answer:
        'They are two formulations of the same treatment from Pfizer, described on one label. Vyndamax is tafamidis 61 mg and Vyndaqel is tafamidis meglumine 20 mg, and the label states they are not interchangeable on a per-milligram basis. For assistance purposes the distinction rarely matters — TotalAssist and HealthWell both list both products, and Pfizer says the VyndaLink support offerings available for Vyndamax are also available for Vyndaqel.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Vyndamax part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price data file has no Vyndamax, Vyndaqel or tafamidis row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028. Your cost is set by your plan\'s specialty-tier cost-sharing. See <a href="/prescription-drug-assistance.html">all prescription assistance options</a>.',
