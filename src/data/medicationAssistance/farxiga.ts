  drugClass: ['sglt2'],
  description:
    'Farxiga is a once-daily SGLT2 inhibitor tablet prescribed for type 2 diabetes, heart failure and chronic kidney disease. It is the medication that started this project — a Vernal customer could not afford it.',
  usedFor: [
    'Chronic kidney disease at risk of progression — to lower the risk of kidney-function decline, kidney failure, cardiovascular death and heart-failure hospitalization',
    'Heart failure — to lower the risk of cardiovascular death, hospitalization and urgent heart-failure visits',
    'Type 2 diabetes with cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors — to lower the risk of heart-failure hospitalization',
    'Type 2 diabetes — to improve blood sugar control alongside diet and exercise (adults and children 10+)',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Farxiga is a brand-name drug that Part D plans usually place on a higher, non-preferred brand tier, so copays or coinsurance can be significant until you reach the annual out-of-pocket cap ($2,100 in 2026). AstraZeneca says generic dapagliflozin became available beginning April 2026 and is winding down its own Farxiga assistance in response — which changes where you should look for help.',
  medicareContext:
    'Farxiga is generally covered under Medicare Part D (or a Medicare Advantage drug plan) for its approved uses, often with prior authorization or step therapy. It is one of the first ten drugs with a Medicare-negotiated Maximum Fair Price: $178.50 for a 30-day supply in 2026 (versus a $556 list price in 2023, per CMS). That price applies to what plans pay; your copay still depends on your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing. Ask your pharmacist whether generic dapagliflozin costs less on your plan.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Possibly — but the picture for Farxiga changed in 2026. AstraZeneca\'s AZ&Me patient assistance program stopped taking new Farxiga patients on May 1, 2026, and the main diabetes, heart-failure and kidney charity funds were closed to new applicants when we checked. The routes still open are AstraZeneca\'s $35 direct-purchase option, one geographically limited TotalAssist heart-failure fund, generic dapagliflozin, and Medicare Extra Help.',
    points: [
      'Manufacturer patient assistance: AZ&Me is closed to new Farxiga patients (since May 1, 2026) and removes Farxiga entirely on December 31, 2026.',
      'Farxiga Savings Card: excludes Medicare Part D — do not use it with your plan.',
      'AstraZeneca Direct lists Farxiga at $35.00 per 30 tablets as a self-pay option; ask ASPN Pharmacies whether Part D enrollees qualify.',
      'Charitable grants: Farxiga is on TotalAssist and HealthWell fund lists, but their diabetes, heart-failure and kidney funds were closed — except TotalAssist\'s zip-code-limited heart-failure health-equity fund.',
      'Medicare: negotiated Part D price of $178.50 (30-day) in 2026; Extra Help can cut a covered brand copay to about $12.65 if you qualify.',

      question: 'Can Medicare help pay for Farxiga?',
      answer:
        'Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Farxiga for its approved uses, and since January 1, 2026 Medicare pays a negotiated Maximum Fair Price of $178.50 for a 30-day supply. Your own copay depends on your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, and total out-of-pocket Part D costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can lower a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Farxiga patient assistance program?',
      answer:
        'AstraZeneca\'s AZ&Me program covered Farxiga until 2026, but effective May 1, 2026 it stopped accepting new Farxiga patients. Patients already enrolled keep assistance through December 31, 2026 (last refill request December 15, 2026), with no exceptions or extensions. AZ&Me now directs Farxiga patients to independent nonprofit funds and to AstraZeneca Direct\'s $35-per-30-tablet cash option.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Farxiga savings card if I have Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. AstraZeneca\'s terms exclude patients enrolled in Medicare Part D, Medicaid, Medigap, VA, DoD and TRICARE, and specifically say you may not use the card even if you choose to be processed as a cash-paying patient. Federal anti-kickback rules are the reason manufacturer copay cards exclude government insurance.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Farxiga right now?',
      answer:
        'When we checked on August 26, 2026, Farxiga was listed by TotalAssist (type 2 diabetes, heart failure, CKD and cardiomyopathy funds) and HealthWell (Type 2 Diabetes and two heart-failure Medicare Access funds), but every one of those funds was closed to new applicants except TotalAssist\'s heart-failure health-equity fund, which is limited to certain zip codes. Sign up for fund notifications so you hear when one reopens.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the $35 Farxiga price?',
      answer:
        'AstraZeneca Direct (azpatientdirect.com) lists Farxiga at $35.00 per 30 tablets as a direct-purchase, self-pay option dispensed through ASPN Pharmacies, with a note that offers vary based on eligibility criteria. The page does not state whether Medicare Part D enrollees qualify — call 1-844-692-9633 to ask. A cash purchase outside your plan generally will not count toward your Part D out-of-pocket cap.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Farxiga?',
      answer:
        'AstraZeneca states that several generic equivalents of Farxiga (dapagliflozin) became available beginning April 2026, and cites that as the reason it is removing Farxiga from AZ&Me. Ask your pharmacist and your Part D plan whether generic dapagliflozin is on your formulary and what it costs — for many people it will be the simplest way to lower the bill.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can my doctor\'s office apply for me?',
      answer:
        'For TotalAssist you (the patient) complete the application, and Patient Advocate Foundation then verifies your diagnosis and treatment plan with your doctor directly. HealthWell requires your provider\'s signature to verify the diagnosis. Many practices have staff who help with these applications — ask. Vernal Medicare can also sit down with you and walk through them, free.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if the fund is closed?',
      answer:
        'A closed fund can reopen when funding is replenished — HealthWell says so explicitly, and TotalAssist offers text, email or phone notifications with no waitlist or queue. While you wait: check generic dapagliflozin on your plan, apply for Extra Help if your income and resources are limited, consider the AstraZeneca Direct cash price, and ask your doctor about a formulary exception. See <a href="/prescription-drug-assistance.html">all prescription assistance options</a>.',
