// Symbicort (budesonide / formoterol fumarate dihydrate) — AstraZeneca.
// Independently researched 2026-08-26. Every program below was read on the
// official source cited with it. Batch 6 (spec §24 Phase 4 list) — a NEW slug.
//
// The finding that changes this page, and that the legacy layer got wrong:
// SYMBICORT IS NOT ON THE AZ&Me MEDICATION LIST. AstraZeneca's patient
// assistance program covers Airsupra, Bevespi Aerosphere and Breztri Aerosphere
// on the respiratory side; Symbicort appears nowhere on the included-medications
// page, in its product logos, in its downloadable application list, or in the
// trademark footer. Breztri (Batch 2) is on AZ&Me and Symbicort is not, and the
// difference is the whole shape of this record — so the `azme` tagline in
// data/drugs.ts, which named Symbicort, was corrected in this batch.
//
// The offsetting fact is that Symbicort, unlike Breztri, has generics: DailyMed
// carries the Breyna authorized generic and a generic budesonide/formoterol
// aerosol, and both charitable funds list Breyna alongside the brand.

  description:
    'Symbicort is a twice-daily maintenance inhaler that combines an inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide) with a long-acting bronchodilator (formoterol). It is used for asthma and, at the 160/4.5 strength, for COPD. It is not a rescue inhaler and will not replace one.',
  usedFor: [
    'Treatment of asthma in patients 6 years of age and older',
    'Maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema (SYMBICORT 160/4.5 only)',
    'Not for relief of sudden breathing problems — a rescue inhaler is still needed',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Symbicort is a brand inhaler that Part D plans usually place on a brand tier, and inhalers are a category where deductibles and non-preferred tiers hit hardest early in the year. Two things make this medication different from most of the inhalers on this site, and both matter for cost: AstraZeneca\'s patient assistance program does not cover Symbicort, so there is no free-drug route from the manufacturer — and there are generics. DailyMed carries the Breyna authorized generic and a generic budesonide/formoterol aerosol, and both TotalAssist and HealthWell list Breyna next to the brand on the same funds.',
  medicareContext:
    'Symbicort is covered under Medicare Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan as a maintenance inhaler, commonly on a brand tier and sometimes behind prior authorization or step therapy. It is not a Medicare-negotiated drug: CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Symbicort or budesonide row for 2026, 2027 or 2028. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan can spread what you owe across the year. Because the brand has generic equivalents, ask your plan what it charges for Breyna or generic budesonide/formoterol — for many plans that is the single largest saving available here.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Partly — and the manufacturer route that covers AstraZeneca\'s other inhalers does not cover this one. Symbicort is not on the AZ&Me medication list, so there is no free-drug program from AstraZeneca. The Symbicort savings offer is for commercial insurance only and excludes federal government insurance. Every asthma and COPD charity fund we checked was closed. The routes that remain are Medicare Extra Help, the generic, and fund alerts.',
    points: [
      'AZ&Me Prescription Savings Program: Symbicort is NOT on the included-medications list (August 26, 2026). The AstraZeneca inhalers AZ&Me does cover are Airsupra, Bevespi Aerosphere and Breztri Aerosphere.',
      'Symbicort savings offer: "Eligible patients pay as little as $35 per month," but AstraZeneca states that "government restrictions exclude people enrolled in federal government insurance programs from co-pay support" — that means Medicare Part D.',
      'No manufacturer cash price: AstraZeneca Direct sells Airsupra, Baxfendy, Bevespi, Farxiga, FluMist, Lokelma and Xigduo XR — not Symbicort.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Symbicort?',
      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Symbicort as a maintenance inhaler for asthma and COPD, usually on a brand tier and sometimes with prior authorization or step therapy. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. Ask your plan what it charges for the Breyna generic as well: for many plans that is a lower tier. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Symbicort patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Not from AstraZeneca. Symbicort is not on the AZ&Me Prescription Savings Program medication list — we read that list on August 26, 2026, and the AstraZeneca inhalers it covers are Airsupra, Bevespi Aerosphere and Breztri Aerosphere. This surprises people because AZ&Me does have a Medicare pathway; it just does not apply to a medication the program does not carry. For Symbicort the routes are the generic, Medicare Extra Help, and the charitable funds when they reopen.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Symbicort $35 savings offer with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. AstraZeneca states that "government restrictions exclude people enrolled in federal government insurance programs from co-pay support," which covers Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug coverage. Federal anti-kickback rules are why manufacturer copay offers are closed to Medicare across the board — it is not specific to this medication.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Symbicort right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Symbicort on its COPD and Asthma funds and their health-equity variants, and HealthWell lists it on its COPD – Medicare Access and Asthma funds — five listings, and every one was closed to new applicants. Good Days has no lung fund. Sign up for alerts on all of them; TotalAssist has no waitlist, so the notification is what gets you in.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Symbicort?',
      answer:
        'Yes. DailyMed carries Breyna (budesonide and formoterol fumarate), an authorized generic, and a generic budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate aerosol, alongside AstraZeneca\'s Symbicort. Both TotalAssist and HealthWell list Breyna next to the brand on the same funds. Ask your prescriber and your plan what the generic costs on your formulary — with no manufacturer assistance program for Symbicort, this is usually the largest saving available.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Symbicort part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price data file has no Symbicort or budesonide row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028. (Two inhalers are in the program — Breo Ellipta and Trelegy Ellipta from 2027 — but Symbicort is not one of them.) Your cost is set by your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if the fund is closed?',
      answer:
        'TotalAssist offers text, email or automated-call notifications when a fund opens, with no waitlist or queue; HealthWell offers alerts on each fund page. While you wait, the routes that do not depend on a fund balance are the generic, Extra Help, a formulary exception through your doctor, the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan, and a Part D plan comparison in the fall.
