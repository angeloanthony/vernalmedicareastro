  // apixaban — factor Xa inhibitor, i.e. an anticoagulant (Eliquis US PI).
  drugClass: ['anticoagulant'],
  description:
    'Eliquis is a twice-daily oral anticoagulant (a factor Xa inhibitor) used to prevent strokes in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and to treat or prevent blood clots. It is one of the most commonly prescribed brand-name drugs among Medicare beneficiaries.',
  usedFor: [
    'Reducing the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation',
    'Preventing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after hip or knee replacement surgery',
    'Treating DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE), and reducing the risk of them recurring',
    'Treating venous thromboembolism in children after initial anticoagulant treatment',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Eliquis is a brand-name drug with no generic at the pharmacy counter in the United States, usually placed on a preferred or non-preferred brand tier with a copay or coinsurance every month. Bristol Myers Squibb lists the price of a 30-day supply at $346 and says Medicare patients pay on average about $51 a month — but that is an average, and people who have not reached their deductible or the $2,100 Part D cap can pay far more.',
  medicareContext:
    'Eliquis is generally covered under Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans. It is one of the first ten drugs with a Medicare-negotiated Maximum Fair Price: $231.00 for a 30-day supply in 2026 (versus a $521 list price in 2023, per CMS). Bristol Myers Squibb notes the negotiated price is what Medicare pays and does not by itself set what you pay — your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing still decide your copay.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes, there are real routes — but not a charitable grant right now. Bristol Myers Squibb\'s patient assistance foundation accepts Medicare patients who have already spent at least 3% of their yearly income on prescriptions, the free 30-day trial is open to Medicare patients, and Extra Help can lower the copay. Every charity fund we checked for atrial fibrillation, blood clots or stroke was closed or did not exist.',

        'It is the manufacturer\'s Direct-to-Patient cash price for a 30-day supply (60 tablets) with free home delivery. The program states that patients in Medicare Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan are not eligible, and that payments do not count toward any deductible or out-of-pocket maximum.

      question: 'Is there a generic for Eliquis?',
      answer:
        'Not at U.S. pharmacies as of our August 2026 check — Eliquis remains a brand-only medication here, which is part of why it was selected for Medicare price negotiation. Ask your pharmacist if this changes; we will update this page when it does.',

      question: 'Can my doctor\'s office apply for me?',
      answer:
        'The BMSPAF application has a prescriber section your doctor must complete, sign and date, and the decision is faxed to the office — so the practice is part of the process either way. Many offices have staff who handle these applications routinely. Vernal Medicare can also walk through the forms with you, free.',

      question: 'What happens if the fund is closed?',
