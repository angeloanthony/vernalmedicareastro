// Independently researched 2026-08-26. Every program below was read on the

//
// NOTE: GSK publishes no covered-medicine list for its Patient Assistance
// Program. Trelegy's inclusion is implied (GSK's Trelegy pricing page sends
// Medicare/uninsured patients to the PAP eligibility check; the application
// carves out only Nucala, Benlysta and oncology products) but is not stated —

  drugClass: ['triple-inhaler'],
  description:
    'Trelegy Ellipta is a once-daily maintenance inhaler that combines an inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone furoate) with two long-acting bronchodilators (umeclidinium and vilanterol) for COPD and for asthma in adults. It is not a rescue inhaler.',
  usedFor: [
    'Long-term maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, in adults (100/62.5/25 mcg strength)',
    'Long-term maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 18 and older (100/62.5/25 or 200/62.5/25 mcg)',
    'Not for the relief of sudden breathing problems — a rescue inhaler is still needed',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Trelegy Ellipta is a brand-name inhaler with no FDA-approved generic. GSK lists its price at $697.73 for a 30-day supply as of January 1, 2026, and Part D plans usually place it on a brand tier with a copay or coinsurance every month until you reach the $2,100 annual out-of-pocket cap. A generic application was accepted for FDA review in January 2026 but had not been approved when we checked.',
  medicareContext:
    'Trelegy Ellipta is generally covered under Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans, sometimes with prior authorization or step therapy versus other inhalers. It was selected for the second round of Medicare drug price negotiation: CMS reports a negotiated price of $175 for a 30-day supply that takes effect January 1, 2027 (against a $654 list price in 2024). That price is what plans pay from 2027 — your copay still depends on your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, and for the rest of 2026 the negotiated price does not apply.',

      'Some help exists, but every charity fund we checked was closed. GSK\'s patient assistance program accepts Medicare Part D patients who have already paid $600 out of pocket for prescriptions this year and meet its income limits — though GSK does not publish a list of covered medicines, so confirm Trelegy by phone.

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Trelegy Ellipta?',
      answer:
        'Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Trelegy Ellipta as a maintenance inhaler for COPD and asthma, usually on a brand tier and sometimes with prior authorization or step therapy. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. From January 1, 2027, Medicare\'s negotiated price of $175 for a 30-day supply applies to what plans pay. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can lower a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Trelegy patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'GSK\'s Patient Assistance Program accepts Medicare Part D enrollees who have paid $600 for prescriptions through their plan in the current calendar year and whose household income is at or below $47,880 (one person) or $64,920 (two). GSK does not publish a list of the medicines it covers, so call 1-866-728-4368 to confirm Trelegy before applying. Approved patients receive the medicine at no cost, shipped in up to 90-day supplies.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Trelegy coupon with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. GSK\'s savings offer is for commercially insured patients only. Its terms exclude anyone enrolled in Medicare Part B, Medicare Part D, Medicaid, Medigap, VA, Department of Defense programs or TRICARE, and Medicare-eligible retirees on employer group waiver plans. The routes for Medicare patients are the GSK Patient Assistance Program, charitable funds and Extra Help.',

      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Trelegy right now?',
      answer:
        'Not when we checked on August 26, 2026. TotalAssist lists Trelegy under its COPD and Asthma funds, and HealthWell lists it under its Asthma and COPD – Medicare Access funds, but all of those were closed to new applicants. Good Days has no lung fund. Sign up for TotalAssist and HealthWell alerts and check back — funds open when money arrives.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Trelegy Ellipta?',
      answer:
        'Not as of our August 2026 check. FDA\'s Drugs@FDA database lists only GSK\'s brand application for the three-ingredient combination. A generic application was accepted for FDA review in January 2026 but had not been approved. Ask your pharmacist if this changes; we will update this page when it does.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the Medicare negotiated price for Trelegy?',
      answer:
        'CMS reports a negotiated price of $175 for a 30-day supply of Trelegy Ellipta, effective January 1, 2027, compared with a 2024 list price of $654. It does not apply in 2026, and it sets what Part D plans pay rather than your copay directly — your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing still decide what you owe at the pharmacy.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if the fund is closed?',
      answer:
        'TotalAssist offers text, email or phone notifications when a fund opens, with no waitlist or queue; HealthWell offers alerts for each fund. While you wait, the routes that do not depend on a fund balance are the GSK program ($600 rule), Extra Help, a formulary exception through your doctor, and a Part D plan comparison in the fall.
