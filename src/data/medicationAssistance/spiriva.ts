// Spiriva (tiotropium bromide) — Boehringer Ingelheim. Independently researched
// 2026-08-26. Batch 6 (spec §24 Phase 4 list) — a NEW slug.
//
// RESEARCH LIMIT, STATED UP FRONT because it shapes two program cards below:
// every Boehringer Ingelheim host that serves patient-facing pages refused
// automated access on 2026-08-26 — boehringer-ingelheim.com,
// patient.boehringer-ingelheim.com and pro.boehringer-ingelheim.com all
// returned an Incapsula block page, and spiriva.com redirects into the blocked
// host. Only docs.boehringer-ingelheim.com, which serves prescribing
// information and savings-card terms as PDFs, could be read — and the savings
// card terms it serves carry a program expiration of 12/31/2024, so they are
// not current terms. The BI programs below are therefore `verify`, with exactly
// what could and could not be confirmed written into each status note. The
// project rule is that an inaccessible official source produces `verify`, never
// a borrowed fact from a sibling drug or another manufacturer.
//
// Separate legacy finding, recorded for the deferred data-hygiene task rather
// than acted on here: bicares.org — the URL the legacy PROGRAMS entry still
// points at — is a non-existent domain (NXDOMAIN on both 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1).
// BI's program now lives under boehringer-ingelheim.com, the applyUrl below.

  description:
    'Spiriva is a once-daily maintenance inhaler containing tiotropium, a long-acting anticholinergic that keeps the airway muscle relaxed. It comes in two devices with different approved uses: the HandiHaler, a capsule you load into an inhaler, for COPD; and the Respimat, a soft-mist inhaler, for COPD and for asthma in people 6 and older. Neither is a rescue inhaler.',
  usedFor: [
    'Long-term, once-daily maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with COPD, and reducing COPD exacerbations (HandiHaler and Respimat)',
    'Long-term, once-daily maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 6 years of age and older (Respimat only)',
    'Not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm — a rescue inhaler is still needed',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Spiriva is a brand inhaler that Part D plans typically place on a brand tier, where a deductible or a non-preferred tier can make the first fills of the year expensive. Which device you are prescribed matters to cost: a generic tiotropium bromide capsule is labelled with FDA and can substitute for the HandiHaler, while the Respimat soft-mist inhaler appears on DailyMed only as the Boehringer Ingelheim product. The manufacturer savings card is for commercial insurance and excludes Medicare, so a Part D beneficiary pays the plan\'s cost-sharing until the annual out-of-pocket cap is reached.',
  medicareContext:
    'Spiriva is covered under Medicare Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan as a maintenance inhaler — commonly a brand tier, sometimes with prior authorization or step therapy. It is not a Medicare-negotiated drug: CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file contains no Spiriva or tiotropium row for 2026, 2027 or 2028. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026; Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources; the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan spreads what you owe across the year without lowering it. If you use the HandiHaler, ask your plan what the generic tiotropium capsule costs — that is often the largest single saving available.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Probably — but the manufacturer\'s own terms could not be confirmed, so treat the Boehringer Ingelheim routes as "call and check" rather than as settled. Boehringer Ingelheim runs a patient assistance program that its own foundation lists Spiriva HandiHaler and Spiriva Respimat under, and a directory updated in April 2026 says Medicare Part D patients may be eligible. Every COPD and asthma charity fund we checked was closed. The generic capsule and Medicare Extra Help are the routes with no fund balance attached.',

Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If you use the HandiHaler, ask what your plan charges for generic tiotropium capsules. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',

We could not confirm its current income limit or its Medicare rules, because every Boehringer Ingelheim patient page refused automated access on August 26, 2026. An independent directory updated in April 2026 records that Medicare Part D patients may be eligible and that the income limit is not published. Call 1-800-556-8317 and ask them directly rather than relying on a second-hand figure.',

      question: 'Can I use the Spiriva savings card with Medicare?',

For the Respimat soft-mist inhaler, no generic spray is labelled. If cost is the problem and you use the Respimat, that difference is worth raising with your prescriber.',

    {
      question: 'Why does this page say "check current availability" for the manufacturer programs?',
