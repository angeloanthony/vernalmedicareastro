// Nexlizet (bempedoic acid and ezetimibe) — Esperion Therapeutics.
// Independently researched 2026-08-26. Batch 8 — a NEW slug.
//
// Nexlizet shares Esperion's entire manufacturer layer with Nexletol — the co-pay
// card is literally called the "NEXLIZET & NEXLETOL Co-Pay Card" — and this record
// does not pretend to a difference that does not exist. It earns its page on two
// facts that are specific to the combination product:
//
//  1. HALF OF NEXLIZET IS A CHEAP GENERIC. Nexlizet is bempedoic acid plus
//     ezetimibe in one tablet. Bempedoic acid is brand-only; ezetimibe has been
//     generic for years and appears on TotalAssist's hypercholesterolemia fund in
//     its own right. So a Medicare beneficiary facing brand-tier cost-sharing on
//     Nexlizet has an option a Nexletol patient does not: ask whether taking
//     Nexletol and generic ezetimibe as two tablets costs less than the
//     combination. That is a real, actionable arithmetic question, and it is the
//     single most useful thing on this page.
//  2. AN OPEN FUND. TotalAssist's Hypercholesterolemia fund was ACCEPTING
//     APPLICATIONS on the checked date, at $1,900 guaranteed and $3,800 maximum,
//     and it lists "Nexlizet (Bempedoic Acid/Ezetimibe)" by name. Open funds are
//     rare in this batch — most records here document closures — so this one is
//     the lead rather than a footnote.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Nexlizet is a single tablet combining two cholesterol medicines: bempedoic acid, which blocks an enzyme the liver uses to make cholesterol a step above where statins act, and ezetimibe, which reduces how much cholesterol your gut absorbs. That two-in-one construction is exactly what makes its cost question different from Nexletol\'s, because one of the two ingredients has been generic for years.',
  usedFor: [
    'Lowering LDL cholesterol, alongside diet, in adults with hypercholesterolemia — including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia — used with other LDL-lowering therapies or alone when they are not possible',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Nexlizet is a brand-only tablet with no generic combination — DailyMed labels only Esperion\'s product — and Part D plans generally place it on a brand tier, often behind step therapy asking you to try a statin first, which is frequently the very thing a Nexlizet candidate could not tolerate. What makes its cost picture unusual is the composition: half of Nexlizet is ezetimibe, an inexpensive generic available on its own. So the brand-tier price you are being charged covers one ingredient that has no alternative and one that does.',
  medicareContext:
    'Nexlizet is a tablet you take yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, usually on a brand tier with step therapy. It is not a Medicare-negotiated drug: CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Nexlizet, Nexletol or bempedoic acid row for 2026, 2027 or 2028. Esperion publishes no patient assistance program that gives Nexlizet away on an income test, and its co-pay card excludes Medicare by name — so for a Part D beneficiary the manufacturer offers no route at all. That makes the charitable and Medicare-side options the whole picture, and fortunately one of them was open when we checked. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Nexlizet?',
      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Nexlizet, usually on a brand tier and often behind step therapy that asks you to try a statin first. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Nexlizet patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Not from Esperion. Its published support for Nexlizet is the NEXSTEP program — a co-pay card for commercially insured patients and a Navigator access service — and no income-based program that supplies Nexlizet free of charge appears on those pages. The co-pay card excludes Medicare explicitly. For a Medicare beneficiary the route that does exist is charitable: TotalAssist\'s Hypercholesterolemia fund was open when we checked, lists Nexlizet, and pays $1,900 guaranteed up to $3,800.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Would taking Nexletol and ezetimibe separately be cheaper than Nexlizet?',
      answer:
        'It is worth asking, and the question only arises because of how Nexlizet is made. Nexlizet combines bempedoic acid — which is brand-only, with no generic in any form — and ezetimibe, which has been generic for years and appears on the TotalAssist fund list in its own right. Some Part D formularies price the brand combination higher than a brand tablet plus a generic tablet taken separately, and some do not. Ask your prescriber whether splitting them is clinically appropriate for you, and ask your plan what each option would cost. It is a genuine arithmetic question rather than a certainty either way.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Nexlizet co-pay card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No, and Esperion\'s terms leave no room. A patient may be eligible only if "not enrolled in any state-, federal-, or government-funded healthcare program, including but not limited to Medicare, Medicaid, Medigap, TRICARE of the Department of Defense, or the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare program." The terms go further than most: a patient enrolled in such a program may not use the card "even if they elect to be processed as a commercial or discount insurance plan patient", and anyone who joins one mid-enrolment must report it and loses eligibility.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Nexlizet right now?',
      answer:
        'Yes — this is one of the few medications in this batch where the answer is a straightforward yes. TotalAssist\'s Hypercholesterolemia fund was accepting applications on August 26, 2026, lists "Nexlizet (Bempedoic Acid/Ezetimibe)" on its approved-medication list, and pays a $1,900 guaranteed award up to $3,800. It requires government insurance — Medicare, Medicaid or TRICARE — so Medicare beneficiaries are exactly who it is designed for. HealthWell\'s Hypercholesterolemia – Medicare Access fund also covers Nexlizet, at up to $2,500, but was closed to new patients.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Nexlizet part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Nexlizet, Nexletol or bempedoic acid row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028. Your cost is set by your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, and by whether a charitable grant or Extra Help is covering part of it.
