  // empagliflozin — SGLT2 inhibitor (Jardiance US prescribing information).
  drugClass: ['sglt2'],
  description:
    'Jardiance is a once-daily SGLT2 inhibitor tablet prescribed for type 2 diabetes, heart failure and chronic kidney disease — the same class as Farxiga, but made by a different company with its own, different assistance program.',
  usedFor: [
    'Heart failure — to lower the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization',
    'Chronic kidney disease at risk of progression — to lower the risk of kidney-function decline, kidney failure, cardiovascular death and hospitalization',
    'Type 2 diabetes with established cardiovascular disease — to lower the risk of cardiovascular death',
    'Type 2 diabetes — to improve blood sugar control alongside diet and exercise (adults and children 10+)',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Jardiance is a brand-name drug with no generic at the pharmacy counter, usually placed on a higher brand tier of Part D formularies, so copays or coinsurance recur every month until you reach the annual out-of-pocket cap ($2,100 in 2026). Unlike Farxiga, its manufacturer still runs a patient assistance program that accepts Medicare Part D enrollees.',
  medicareContext:
    'Jardiance is generally covered under Medicare Part D (or a Medicare Advantage drug plan) for its approved uses, often with prior authorization or step therapy. It is one of the first ten drugs with a Medicare-negotiated Maximum Fair Price: $197.00 for a 30-day supply in 2026 (versus a $573 list price in 2023, per CMS). That price applies to what plans pay; your copay still depends on your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes, possibly. Boehringer Ingelheim\'s patient assistance program (Boehringer Cares) lists Jardiance and accepts Medicare Part D enrollees who do not qualify for Extra Help, with 2026 income limits of $39,900 for one person or $54,100 for two. The charity funds that list Jardiance were closed to new applicants when we checked, except one zip-code-limited TotalAssist heart-failure fund. Extra Help remains open year-round.',

      question: 'Can Medicare help pay for Jardiance?',
      answer:
        'Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Jardiance for its approved uses, and since January 1, 2026 Medicare pays a negotiated Maximum Fair Price of $197 for a 30-day supply. Your own copay depends on your plan\'s tier and cost-sharing, and Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can lower a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Jardiance patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Yes. The Boehringer Cares Patient Assistance Program lists Jardiance and accepts people who have Medicare but cannot afford the medication and do not qualify for Extra Help, with household income at or below 250% of the federal poverty level ($39,900 for one person or $54,100 for two in 2026). Applying is free; call 1-800-556-8317. BI\'s website blocked our automated check on August 26, 2026, so confirm by phone that applications are being accepted.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use the Jardiance savings card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'You should not count on it. BI\'s savings-card screener asks whether your prescriptions are paid by Medicare, Medicaid, Medigap, VA, DoD or TRICARE, and manufacturer copay cards generally exclude government insurance under federal anti-kickback rules. Ask CareConnect4Me (1-866-279-8990) if you want the full terms; the patient assistance program above is the route built for Medicare patients.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a charitable grant for Jardiance right now?',
      answer:
        'When we checked on August 26, 2026, Jardiance was listed by TotalAssist (type 2 diabetes, heart failure, CKD and cardiomyopathy funds) and HealthWell (Type 2 Diabetes and two heart-failure Medicare Access funds), but every one of those funds was closed to new applicants except TotalAssist\'s heart-failure health-equity fund, which is limited to certain zip codes. Sign up for fund notifications so you hear when one reopens.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I apply for Extra Help before Boehringer Cares?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Boehringer Cares is for Medicare patients who do not qualify for Extra Help, and BI may ask for proof of an Extra Help denial. If Social Security approves you for Extra Help, your copays fall on every covered drug; if it denies you, the letter supports your BI application. Either outcome moves you forward.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How is Jardiance assistance different from Farxiga assistance?',
      answer:
        'They are the same class of drug but different companies with different programs. AstraZeneca stopped accepting new Farxiga patients into AZ&Me on May 1, 2026, and generic dapagliflozin is now available; Boehringer Cares still lists Jardiance and there is no generic empagliflozin at the pharmacy counter. Never assume one manufacturer\'s program applies to another company\'s drug — see our <a href="/farxiga-assistance-program.html">Farxiga assistance guide</a> for its own routes.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can my doctor\'s office apply for me?',
      answer:
        'The Boehringer Cares application has prescriber sections your doctor must complete and sign, and the prescription comes from the office — so your doctor\'s office is part of the process either way, and many practices have staff who handle these forms routinely. For TotalAssist and HealthWell you apply and the foundation verifies the diagnosis with your provider. Vernal Medicare can walk through the forms with you, free.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if the fund is closed?',
      answer:
        'TotalAssist offers text, email or phone notifications with no waitlist or queue, and HealthWell says closed funds reopen as funding is replenished. While you wait, the routes that do not depend on a fund balance are Boehringer Cares (for Medicare patients not eligible for Extra Help), Extra Help itself, and a formulary exception through your doctor.
