// Tresiba (insulin degludec) — Novo Nordisk. Independently researched 2026-08-26.
// Batch 8 — a NEW slug. D10 is resolved: one ordinary record per insulin brand.
//
// Tresiba shares Novo Nordisk's assistance layer with NovoLog, and the record
// says so plainly rather than restaging it as new. What is Tresiba-specific:
//
//  • TWO CONCENTRATIONS ON THE PROGRAM. Novo Nordisk's PAP product list names
//    Tresiba U-100 (10 mL vial and FlexTouch) AND Tresiba U-200 FlexTouch. A
//    U-200 pen holds twice the insulin per millilitre, which matters for anyone
//    on a large daily dose and changes how far a 120-day PAP supply goes.
//  • AN UNBRANDED VERSION FROM NOVO NORDISK ITSELF. DailyMed labels an unbranded
//    "INSULIN DEGLUDEC" from Novo Nordisk Pharma alongside Tresiba — seven
//    labelled degludec products across three labelers.
//  • NOT A NEGOTIATED DRUG. Tresiba is NOT on any CMS selected-drug list. This is
//    worth stating because its stablemate NovoLog IS, and readers reasonably
//    assume a manufacturer's insulins were negotiated together. They were not.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Tresiba is an ultra-long-acting background insulin taken once a day. It comes in two concentrations — 100 units/mL and 200 units/mL — and both are on Novo Nordisk\'s patient assistance program, which matters more than it sounds: a U-200 pen carries twice the insulin in the same volume, so for someone on a large daily dose the same 120-day program supply goes considerably further.',
  usedFor: [
    'Improving blood sugar control in adults and children with type 1 or type 2 diabetes — confirm the age range that applies to your prescription with your prescriber',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Background insulin is a daily lifelong expense. For Tresiba specifically, the useful levers are Novo Nordisk\'s patient assistance program, which covers both concentrations; an unbranded insulin degludec that Novo Nordisk itself now labels alongside the brand; and the $35 cash price listed on the federal TrumpRx site. What Tresiba does not have — despite a common assumption — is a Medicare-negotiated price.',
  medicareContext:
    'Tresiba is covered under Medicare Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, and under federal law a covered insulin costs no more than $35 for a month\'s supply with no deductible applied; our <a href="/insulin-cost-medicare-vernal.html">insulin cost guide</a> covers how that works across products. One thing worth correcting up front: Tresiba is NOT a Medicare-negotiated drug. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Tresiba or insulin degludec row for 2026, 2027 or 2028. Its stablemate NovoLog is on the 2026 list, and people reasonably assume a manufacturer\'s insulins were negotiated as a group — they were not, and NovoLog\'s $119.00 negotiated price says nothing about Tresiba. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and check your plan\'s tier for the exact concentration you are prescribed, since U-100 and U-200 are separate products on a formulary.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes — Novo Nordisk\'s patient assistance program covers both Tresiba concentrations, and it is one of the few manufacturer programs that requires you to have Medicare rather than excluding you for it. The significant catch is that you cannot also be enrolled in Extra Help. Both diabetes charitable funds were closed.',

      'For Medicare patients on Novo Nordisk insulins: household income at or below 400% of the federal poverty level. Below 150% FPL you must provide proof of denial for Part D Extra Help.',

Medicare beneficiaries below 150% of the federal poverty level must specifically provide proof that Part D Extra Help denied them.

The unbranded insulin degludec is on the same list, so switching to it would not affect eligibility. HealthWell\'s Type 2 Diabetes fund was closed too, and Good Days runs no diabetes fund. All of these are type 2 funds, and Tresiba is widely used in type 1 diabetes, so a substantial share of readers have no charitable route here at all. One useful asymmetry: these funds do not exclude Extra Help enrollees while Novo Nordisk\'s program does — so if Extra Help has ruled you out of the manufacturer program, the funds are still worth an alert.',

      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans cover Tresiba, and under federal law a covered insulin costs no more than $35 for a month\'s supply with no deductible applied. Check your plan\'s tier for the exact concentration you are prescribed, because U-100 and U-200 are separate formulary entries. Our <a href="/insulin-cost-medicare-vernal.html">insulin cost guide</a> explains how the cap works across products.',

    {
      question: 'Is Tresiba part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No, and this is worth checking rather than assuming. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Tresiba or insulin degludec row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028. Novo Nordisk\'s other insulin, NovoLog, IS on the 2026 list with a negotiated price of $119.00 per 30-day equivalent supply — but that price applies to insulin aspart products only and says nothing about Tresiba. Manufacturers\' insulins were not negotiated as a group.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a Tresiba patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Yes, and it is built for Medicare rather than around it. Novo Nordisk\'s rule is "Have Medicare or no insurance (Note: If you have private or commercial insurance, you are not eligible for the PAP)". All three Tresiba presentations — U-100 vial, U-100 FlexTouch and U-200 FlexTouch — are on the program\'s product list. For Medicare patients on Novo Nordisk insulins, household income must be at or below 400% of the federal poverty level. Approved patients get up to a 120-day supply shipped to a licensed healthcare professional.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I have both Extra Help and the Novo Nordisk program?',
      answer:
        'No. Novo Nordisk requires that you "not be enrolled in or qualify for any other federal, state, or government program such as Medicaid, Medicare Low-Income Subsidy (LIS, or Extra Help Program), or Veterans Affairs (VA) Benefits", and beneficiaries below 150% of the federal poverty level must provide proof that Extra Help denied them. For most people <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Extra Help</a> is the better option, because it applies to every covered drug you take. Apply for it first; if denied, keep the letter, because Novo Nordisk asks for exactly that.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between Tresiba U-100 and U-200?',
      answer:
        'Concentration. U-200 contains 200 units of insulin degludec per millilitre against U-100\'s 100 units, so the same dose takes half the volume and a U-200 pen holds twice as many units as a U-100 pen of the same size. For anyone on a large daily dose that means fewer pens per month, which can change what you pay and how far a 120-day patient assistance supply stretches. Both concentrations are on Novo Nordisk\'s assistance program and on the TotalAssist fund list. Whether U-200 suits you is a prescribing decision.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic version of Tresiba?',
      answer:
        'There is an unbranded version from Novo Nordisk itself. DailyMed lists seven labelled insulin degludec products across three labelers: Tresiba, Xultophy 100/3.6 (a combination product) and an unbranded "Insulin Degludec" from Novo Nordisk Pharma. TotalAssist lists the unbranded product on the same Type 2 diabetes fund as Tresiba, so switching would not cost you fund eligibility. Whether it lowers your copay depends on your plan\'s formulary. See <a href="/prescription-drug-assistance.html">all prescription assistance options</a>.',
