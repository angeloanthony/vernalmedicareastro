// Anoro Ellipta (umeclidinium / vilanterol) — GSK. Independently researched
// 2026-08-26. Batch 8 — a NEW slug.
//
// Three things make this page worth a reader's time rather than a variation on
// the other GSK inhalers:
//
//  1. Anoro Ellipta is on the CMS list of drugs SELECTED FOR NEGOTIATION for
//     initial price applicability year 2028. No maximum fair price is published
//     yet — negotiation happens first — so this page states the selection and
//     explicitly does NOT quote a price, which is the honest position and also
//     the useful one, because "selected" is what a reader can act on today.
//  2. GSK sells it direct for cash at a published price: $222.94 through GSK
//     Direct to You, plus a processing and shipping fee of up to $25. The same
//     product appears on the government's TrumpRx site at $247.94 — exactly the
//     GSK price plus that $25 fee. Two official cash prices for one inhaler is a
//     comparison a reader can actually use.
//  3. An authorized generic exists — DailyMed labels "UMECLIDINIUM AND
//     VILANTEROL ELLIPTA" alongside the brand — and TotalAssist lists the
//     generic on the same fund as the brand.
//
// TAXONOMY: this record introduces `lama-laba`. Anoro is two long-acting
// bronchodilators and no steroid, which none of the existing inhaler keys can
// express, and its label states it is "NOT indicated for... the treatment of
// asthma". That is not a cosmetic distinction here: it is exactly why Anoro
// appears on the COPD charitable funds and NOT on the asthma funds, while Breo
// Ellipta — same manufacturer, same inhaler family — appears on both.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Anoro Ellipta is a once-daily maintenance inhaler for COPD that combines two different long-acting bronchodilators and no steroid. That combination is what separates it from Breo Ellipta and Trelegy Ellipta, which contain an inhaled steroid — and it is why Anoro is licensed for COPD only and appears on the COPD charitable funds rather than the asthma ones.',
  usedFor: [
    'Maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, to improve airflow',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Anoro Ellipta is a once-daily brand inhaler that Part D plans generally place on a brand tier, and COPD maintenance treatment continues indefinitely, so the cost-sharing repeats every month for years. What is unusual here is that there are two published cash prices to compare against your plan: GSK sells Anoro direct for $222.94 plus a fee of up to $25, and the federal TrumpRx site lists it at $247.94, which is the same price with that fee folded in. An authorized generic also exists.',
  medicareContext:
    'Anoro Ellipta is an inhaler you use yourself, so Medicare covers it under Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan. It is one of the 15 drugs CMS selected for the THIRD cycle of Medicare drug price negotiation, with any negotiated price taking effect from January 1, 2028. Selection is not the same as a price: CMS\'s published file carries no maximum fair price for Anoro Ellipta yet, because the negotiation itself happens first, so no dollar figure is quoted on this page. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, Extra Help lowers cost-sharing for people with limited income and resources, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan can spread what you owe across the year.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes — GSK\'s patient assistance program covers Anoro Ellipta and has a Medicare route, but it requires that you have already paid $600 for prescriptions this calendar year. The COPD charitable funds that list Anoro were all closed. Two official cash prices exist for comparison, and an authorized generic is on the market.',

      'GSK Patient Assistance Program: Anoro Ellipta is on the published list of eligible products. Medicare route requires a Medicare drug plan, income at or below $47,880 for one person, and $600 already spent on prescriptions this calendar year.',
      'GSK Direct to You: $222.94 cash, plus a processing and shipping fee of up to $25 — but only if you are not using insurance. The federal TrumpRx site lists the same inhaler at $247.94.',

  charitableSummary:
    'The charitable picture for Anoro Ellipta is narrower than for the steroid-containing inhalers, and the reason is the label rather than the price. Because Anoro is licensed for COPD only, it appears on TotalAssist\'s COPD fund and COPD health equity fund but not on the asthma funds — where Breo Ellipta, which contains a steroid, does appear. Both COPD funds were closed on August 26, 2026, each paying $1,200 guaranteed up to $3,500. HealthWell\'s COPD – Medicare Access fund was closed too, and Good Days runs no COPD fund at all. Usefully, TotalAssist lists the generic "Umeclidinium-Vilanterol" on the same fund as the brand, so switching to the authorized generic would not cost you eligibility if a fund reopens. Set alerts on both foundations, and in the meantime work the GSK program, the generic and the cash-price comparison.',
  extraHelpNote:
    'GSK\'s Medicare route for Anoro does not exclude Extra Help enrollees — its gate is the $600 prescription-spending threshold, not your subsidy status — so there is nothing to weigh up between the two. Apply for Extra Help on its own merits. With full Extra Help a covered brand-name drug costs about $12.65 in 2026, which for a once-daily maintenance inhaler taken indefinitely is a larger annual difference than it first sounds.',

      question: 'Does Medicare cover Anoro Ellipta?',
      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans generally cover Anoro Ellipta, usually on a brand tier. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. If your income and resources are limited, <a href="/medicare-extra-help-utah.html">Medicare Extra Help</a> can bring a covered brand-name copay to about $12.65. Anoro is also a selected drug for Medicare price negotiation, with any negotiated price taking effect from January 1, 2028.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there an Anoro Ellipta patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Anoro Ellipta is on the GSK Patient Assistance Program\'s published list of eligible products, and the program has a Medicare route. The requirement people miss is the spending threshold: for GSK\'s "general" medicines, which includes Anoro, you must have "paid a total of $600 for prescriptions in the current calendar year". You also need a Medicare drug plan and income at or below $47,880 for one person in the 48 states and DC. Both you and your prescriber sign the form.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Has Medicare negotiated a price for Anoro Ellipta?',
      answer:
        'Not yet — but it has been selected. Anoro Ellipta is one of the 15 drugs on CMS\'s selected-drug list for initial price applicability year 2028. Selection means negotiation happens first and any resulting maximum fair price takes effect January 1, 2028. CMS\'s published data file carries an empty price column for Anoro today, so anyone quoting you a negotiated Anoro price now is quoting something CMS has not published.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why is Anoro Ellipta on the COPD charity funds but not the asthma ones?',
      answer:
        'Because of what its label says. Anoro combines two long-acting bronchodilators — umeclidinium and vilanterol — and contains no inhaled steroid, and the label states it is "NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or for the treatment of asthma." The charitable funds follow the approved indication, so Anoro appears on TotalAssist\'s COPD funds and not its Asthma fund. Breo Ellipta, which contains a steroid and is licensed for both, appears on both. If your inhaler was prescribed for asthma, check that it is the right one for the fund you are applying to.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I buy Anoro Ellipta with cash instead of using Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Sometimes, but check the arithmetic first. GSK sells Anoro direct at $222.94 plus a processing and shipping fee of up to $25, and the federal TrumpRx site lists it at $247.94 — the same price with the fee included. GSK\'s own terms say the offer "is not available to patients who wish to use insurance", and GSK adds "If you have insurance, check with your pharmacy, your price may be lower." The catch for a Medicare beneficiary is that cash spending outside your Part D benefit does not count toward your deductible or your annual out-of-pocket cap.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Anoro Ellipta?',
      answer:
        'Yes, an authorized generic. DailyMed lists five labelled umeclidinium products across two labelers: GSK\'s Anoro Ellipta, Incruse Ellipta and Trelegy Ellipta, plus "Umeclidinium and Vilanterol Ellipta" and "Umeclidinium Ellipta". TotalAssist lists the generic on the same COPD fund as the brand, so switching would not cost you fund eligibility. Whether it lowers your copay depends on your plan\'s formulary.
