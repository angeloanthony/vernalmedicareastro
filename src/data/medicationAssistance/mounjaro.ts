  description:
    'Mounjaro is a once-weekly injectable GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist for type 2 diabetes. Lilly states plainly that Mounjaro is not a weight-loss drug — the same molecule is sold for weight management as Zepbound, and the two are treated differently by Medicare.',
  usedFor: [
    'Improving blood sugar in adults and children 10 and older with type 2 diabetes, along with diet and exercise',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Lilly lists Mounjaro at $1,112.16 for a 28-day supply. Part D plans usually place it on a high brand tier with prior authorization confirming a type 2 diabetes diagnosis, so the monthly copay or coinsurance can be large until you reach the $2,100 annual cap. Mounjaro has not been selected for Medicare price negotiation, and the manufacturer\'s patient assistance program does not cover it.',
  medicareContext:
    'Medicare Part D covers GLP-1 medicines such as Mounjaro when prescribed for type 2 diabetes, not for weight loss alone. The Medicare GLP-1 Bridge ($50 a month, July 1, 2026 – December 31, 2027) does not include Mounjaro and excludes people with type 2 diabetes. CMS lists Mounjaro under its BALANCE Model, but says that model is not launching in Medicare in 2027. Tirzepatide has not been selected for Medicare drug price negotiation for 2026, 2027 or 2028.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Assistance for Mounjaro on Medicare is limited right now. Lilly Cares does not cover Mounjaro, the savings card excludes Medicare, and the type 2 diabetes charity funds at TotalAssist and HealthWell were closed to new applicants when we checked. What remains: Lilly\'s $499-a-month self-pay price through LillyDirect (open to Medicare enrollees paying cash), Medicare Extra Help, and fund notifications for when a diabetes fund reopens.',
