// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Tezspire (tezepelumab-ekko) — Amgen, developed with AstraZeneca.
// Independently researched 2026-08-26. Batch 8 — a NEW slug.
//
// Tezspire completes the severe-asthma biologic set on this site alongside Nucala
// and Xolair, and the three turn out to be assisted by three completely different
// organisations under three completely different rules — GSK's own foundation for
// Nucala, Genentech's for Xolair, and Amgen's for Tezspire. A reader switching
// between biologics has to start the assistance question over each time, and this
// page says so.
//
// RESEARCH GAP CARRIED HONESTLY. Two of Amgen's figures could not be established
// at the source and are therefore NOT published here:
//   • amgensafetynetfoundation.com/eligibility returned HTTP 403 (AccessDenied) to
//     every automated request on the checked date, so the foundation's income
//     limits and its Medicare rule could not be read.
//   • Amgen's own Tezspire access page (amgensupportplus.com) does not publish the
//     copay program's dollar amounts — it defers to the Tezspire Together terms.
//     Dollar figures for this card circulate on third-party sites; none of them
//     were confirmed at an Amgen source, so none appear on this page.
// What COULD be established is quoted, including the one Medicare-relevant detail
// Amgen's enrolment form does make explicit: it requires a Provider Transaction
// Access Number (PTAN) "if the patient has Medicare", which tells you the program
// contemplates Medicare patients and routes them through the prescriber.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Tezspire is an injected biologic given as add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma. It works further upstream than the other severe-asthma biologics on this site, which is why it is used in people whose asthma does not fit a single allergic or eosinophilic pattern. For assistance purposes the important thing is that it is an Amgen medicine: the program, the rules and the phone numbers are entirely separate from those covering Nucala or Xolair.',
  usedFor: [
    'Add-on maintenance treatment of severe asthma in adults and adolescents — confirm the exact age range and criteria on your own prescription with your prescriber',
    'Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where the label supports it — check with your prescriber which indication yours was written for',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Tezspire is a brand-only biologic with no generic and no biosimilar — DailyMed labels exactly one tezepelumab product. Part D plans place it on a specialty tier, where you pay a percentage of the price rather than a flat copay, and almost always behind prior authorization. Coinsurance at that level tends to consume the annual out-of-pocket cap in the first months of the year rather than spreading across it.',
  medicareContext:
    'Tezspire is covered under Medicare Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan when you or a caregiver inject it at home, generally on a specialty tier with prior authorization. If your doses are given in a clinic, the billing route can differ, so ask your prescriber\'s office which benefit applies before planning around a figure. Tezspire is not a Medicare-negotiated drug: CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Tezspire or tezepelumab row for 2026, 2027 or 2028 — worth checking rather than assuming, since Xolair, another severe-asthma biologic, was selected for 2028. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan can spread what you owe across the year, which for a specialty-tier biologic is often the practical difference between manageable and not.',

    'Tezspire has a narrower charitable footprint than the other severe-asthma biologics on this site, and the difference is worth knowing if you have been switched between them. TotalAssist lists Tezspire on its Asthma fund and Asthma health equity fund — each $1,200 guaranteed up to $3,500, both closed on August 26, 2026 — but not on its COPD fund, where Nucala and Dupixent both appear. HealthWell\'s Asthma fund was closed and it runs no severe- or eosinophilic-asthma fund at all; Good Days has no asthma fund. With the Amgen foundation\'s terms unverified and every fund shut, the routes you can act on today are the phone call to Amgen, Extra Help, and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan. Set alerts on TotalAssist and HealthWell so a reopening does not pass you by.',
  extraHelpNote:
    'Extra Help matters more than usual for Tezspire, because it is the one route on this page whose rules are fully published and immediately checkable.

If your doses are given in a clinic, the billing route can differ, so ask your prescriber\'s office which benefit applies. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026, and the <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/prescription-payment-plan">Medicare Prescription Payment Plan</a> can spread that across the year.',

      question: 'Is there a Tezspire patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Amgen runs the Amgen Safety Net Foundation and Tezspire is covered by it, but we could not confirm its current Medicare rule or income limits — the foundation\'s eligibility page returned an access-denied error to every automated request on August 26, 2026. Rather than repeat figures from third-party sites, this page records the gap. Two confirmed clues are encouraging: Amgen describes the foundation as serving people whose "insurance plan excludes the Amgen medicine", and the enrolment form requires a prescriber PTAN "if the patient has Medicare". Call TEZSPIRE Together on 888-897-7473 and ask directly.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why does this page not give a dollar amount for the Tezspire copay card?',
      answer:
        'Because Amgen does not publish one on its own access page — it states that "Eligibility criteria and program maximums apply" and refers readers to the Tezspire Together terms and conditions. Dollar figures for this card do circulate on third-party sites, but none of them could be confirmed at an Amgen source, and this project does not publish an assistance figure it has not seen at the source. In any case the card excludes Medicare, so for most readers of this page the number would not change anything.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does Tezspire assistance differ from Nucala or Xolair?',
      answer:
        'Completely, and that surprises people who switch between them. All three are severe-asthma biologics, but Nucala is a GSK medicine assisted by the GSK Patient Access Programs Foundation, Xolair is a Genentech medicine assisted by the Genentech Patient Foundation with its distinctive 7.5%-of-income test, and Tezspire is an Amgen medicine assisted by the Amgen Safety Net Foundation. Different applications, different income rules, different phone numbers, and different charitable fund eligibility — Tezspire is not on the COPD fund that lists Nucala. If your biologic changes, start the assistance question over.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic or biosimilar for Tezspire?',
      answer:
        'No. DailyMed lists exactly one labelled tezepelumab product. There is no generic and no biosimilar, so there is no lower-tier version to ask your prescriber about. That is part of why the specialty-tier coinsurance is difficult, and why Extra Help and the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan carry so much of the weight here.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Tezspire part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Tezspire or tezepelumab row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028. This is worth checking rather than assuming, because Xolair — another severe-asthma biologic — was selected for 2028. Your Tezspire cost is set by your plan\'s specialty-tier coinsurance.
