// Lyumjev (insulin lispro-aabc) — Eli Lilly. Independently researched
// 2026-08-26. Batch 8 — a NEW slug. D10 is resolved: one ordinary record per
// insulin brand.
//
// Lyumjev is the fifth and last insulin in this batch, and it is the one whose
// manufacturer program is written most clearly for Medicare. Where Sanofi states
// no Medicare rule at all and Novo Nordisk excludes Extra Help enrollees, Lilly
// Cares says the opposite in plain words:
//
//   "Group 2 Medications: For patients who have no insurance OR HAVE MEDICARE
//    PART D and have a household annual adjusted gross income ≤ 400% FPL."
//
// Lyumjev is a Group 2 medication. Lilly publishes an actual dollar table
// ($63,840 for one person) rather than pointing elsewhere, and it names its FPL
// percentages explicitly (Group 1 = 300%, Group 2 = 400%, Groups 3–4 = 500%).
// That makes this the most checkable manufacturer program of the five insulins.
//
// The one exclusion that still applies: "You are not enrolled in Medicaid, full
// Low Income Subsidy (LIS, 'Extra Help') or Veterans (VA) Benefits." Note the
// word FULL — Lilly's exclusion is narrower than Novo Nordisk's, which bars
// anyone who is enrolled in or merely qualifies for Extra Help.
//
// Second Lyumjev-specific point: it is insulin lispro-AABC, not plain insulin
// lispro. The suffix denotes a distinct product; generic and biosimilar insulin
// lispro products exist, but they are not substitutes for Lyumjev without a
// prescribing decision.
//
// Built LINK-DARK under D8: no does-medicare-cover-* link appears in this record.

  description:
    'Lyumjev is Eli Lilly\'s ultra-rapid mealtime insulin — insulin lispro reformulated to start working faster, which is what the "-aabc" suffix in its name signifies. That suffix matters practically: several plain insulin lispro products are on the market, including an unbranded one from Lilly itself, but they are different products rather than interchangeable versions of Lyumjev.',
  usedFor: [
    'Improving blood sugar control in adults and children with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, taken around mealtimes',
  ],
  whyCostly:
    'Mealtime insulin is used several times a day for life. What sets Lyumjev apart on cost is not the price but the clarity of the help: the Lilly Cares Foundation publishes an explicit dollar income table and states in so many words that Medicare Part D enrollees may apply — which neither Sanofi nor Novo Nordisk does for their insulins. Lilly\'s $35 card, by contrast, excludes Medicare entirely.',
  medicareContext:
    'Lyumjev is covered under Medicare Part D or a Medicare Advantage drug plan, and under federal law a covered insulin costs no more than $35 for a month\'s supply with no deductible applied; our <a href="/insulin-cost-medicare-vernal.html">insulin cost guide</a> covers how that works across products. Lyumjev is not a Medicare-negotiated drug — CMS\'s selected-drug file has no Lyumjev or insulin lispro row for 2026, 2027 or 2028, and the only insulin ever selected is Novo Nordisk\'s insulin aspart. Part D out-of-pocket costs are capped at $2,100 in 2026. Worth noting for anyone comparing insulins: Lyumjev comes in U-100 and U-200 KwikPens and a Junior KwikPen, and these are separate formulary entries, so check the tier for the exact presentation you are prescribed.',
  quickAnswer: {
    verdict:
      'Yes, and this is the clearest of the five insulin programs on this site. Lilly Cares states plainly that Group 2 medications — which include Lyumjev — are "For patients who have no insurance or have Medicare Part D" with income at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, and it publishes the actual dollar figures. The one bar is full Extra Help. Both diabetes charitable funds were closed.',

Having Medicare Part D is a qualifying route, stated in those words, not an inference. The exclusion to watch is narrower than it first appears: "You are not enrolled in Medicaid, full Low Income Subsidy (LIS, \'Extra Help\') or Veterans (VA) Benefits." Lilly bars full Extra Help specifically, where Novo Nordisk bars anyone who is enrolled in OR qualifies for it — so a partial-subsidy situation may play out differently between the two companies.

    'TotalAssist lists every Lyumjev presentation on its Type 2 diabetes fund and the health-equity version, each paying $1,500 guaranteed up to $2,000, and both were closed on August 26, 2026. HealthWell\'s Type 2 Diabetes fund was closed too, and Good Days runs no diabetes fund. As with every insulin on this site these are type 2 funds only, which leaves people taking Lyumjev for type 1 diabetes without a charitable route on these three foundations. That matters less here than it might elsewhere, because Lyumjev has the most reachable manufacturer program of the five insulins: Lilly Cares names Medicare Part D as a qualifying route and publishes its dollar limits, so you can settle your eligibility from the page rather than by waiting for a fund to reopen.',
  extraHelpNote:
    'Lyumjev is the insulin where the Extra Help question is worth reading carefully rather than assuming. Lilly Cares excludes people enrolled in "full Low Income Subsidy (LIS, \'Extra Help\')" — the word full is doing real work, and it makes Lilly\'s bar narrower than Novo Nordisk\'s, which excludes anyone who is enrolled in or merely qualifies for Extra Help. If you receive a partial subsidy rather than the full one, ask Lilly Cares directly on 1-800-545-6962 whether you remain eligible; the published wording suggests you might, and it is a question worth asking rather than answering yourself. If you do have full Extra Help, use it: it reduces cost-sharing on every covered drug you take, and a covered insulin is capped at $35 a month regardless.',

      answer:
        'Yes — Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage drug plans cover Lyumjev, and under federal law a covered insulin costs no more than $35 for a month\'s supply with no deductible applied. Check your plan\'s tier for the exact presentation you are prescribed, since the KwikPen U-100, KwikPen U-200 and Junior KwikPen are separate formulary entries. Our <a href="/insulin-cost-medicare-vernal.html">insulin cost guide</a> explains how the cap works.',

    {
      question: 'Is there a Lyumjev patient assistance program for people on Medicare?',
      answer:
        'Yes, and Lilly says so in plain words rather than leaving it to inference. Lyumjev is a Group 2 medication under the Lilly Cares Foundation, and Lilly defines Group 2 as "For patients who have no insurance or have Medicare Part D and have a household annual adjusted gross income ≤ 400% FPL". The dollar limits are published: $63,840 for one person, $86,560 for two, up to $177,440 for six. Approved patients receive Lyumjev free for up to 12 months and reapply annually. The program charges no fee.',
    },
    {
      question: 'I get Extra Help. Does that rule me out of Lilly Cares?',
      answer:
        'It depends on whether yours is full Extra Help, and the wording matters. Lilly Cares excludes patients "enrolled in Medicaid, full Low Income Subsidy (LIS, \'Extra Help\') or Veterans (VA) Benefits". That is narrower than Novo Nordisk\'s rule, which excludes anyone enrolled in or merely qualifying for Extra Help. If you receive a partial subsidy, call Lilly Cares on 1-800-545-6962 and ask rather than assuming — this is exactly the kind of distinction that decides an application.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use Lilly\'s $35 insulin card with Medicare?',
      answer:
        'No. Lilly\'s terms require that "You are not enrolled in any state, federal, or government funded healthcare program, including, without limitation, Medicaid, Medicare, Medicare Part D, Medicare Advantage, Medigap, DoD, VA, TRICARE®/CHAMPUS." Lilly states the reason plainly itself: "Government restrictions exclude people enrolled in federal government insurance programs from Lilly\'s $35 solutions." The practical loss is small, because federal law already caps a covered insulin at $35 a month under a Medicare drug plan — and unlike the card, that spending counts toward your annual out-of-pocket cap. The card also expires on 12/31/2026.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a generic for Lyumjev?',
      answer:
        'Not for Lyumjev itself. Lyumjev is insulin lispro-aabc — a distinct formulation designed to act faster — and DailyMed lists it as the only product with that suffix. There are several plain insulin lispro products: Lilly\'s Humalog and its unbranded insulin lispro, and Sanofi\'s Admelog, across 16 labelled products and six labelers in total. Those are different medicines rather than interchangeable versions of Lyumjev, so switching is a prescribing decision for your doctor, not a substitution at the pharmacy counter.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Lyumjev part of Medicare drug price negotiation?',
      answer:
        'No. CMS\'s selected-drug and Maximum Fair Price file has no Lyumjev or insulin lispro row for initial price applicability year 2026, 2027 or 2028. The only insulin CMS has ever selected is Novo Nordisk\'s insulin aspart, sold as NovoLog and Fiasp, for 2026 — a different product from a different manufacturer, and its negotiated price does not apply here.
